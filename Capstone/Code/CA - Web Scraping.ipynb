ZERO Star rating I would. I\\'m extremely upset by my experience with Sprint and T-Mobile. On 08/21/2020 I went to our T Mobile store to migrate from Sprint to T Mobile. After about 2 hrs the helpful Store Manager and his store Clerk told me we have to wait 48 hrs. There is a problem with Sprint. I received a call 2 days later from Sprint. All clear. Back at T Mobile store, 3 more hrs. same result. Cannot migrate. 2 days later I call Sprint and they transfer me to T Mobile. 3 hrs on Phone I was told all clear go, so I go back to Store but still not solved. So I call T Mobile customer service again. 2.5 hrs and was promised \"You can go to Store, they will put SIM card in your phone and you\\'re good to go.\"\\n              </p>\\n              <div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-8234963-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-8234963\">\\n               <p>\\n                On 08/28/2020 1 week of Nightmare I give it another try. Back to store oooo. No, same trouble so I spent 3 more hrs. at store and told I am not leaving till it\\'s done. Well it got done. So I go home and work on changes on phone and PC to find out I have the wrong Account now. So I call T Mobile to get the right account. Was told I have to go back to Store So I ask for Supervisor to explain my frustrations. After 30 min on hold I got some foreigner answer saying he is the Supervisor and more or less told me he does NOT CARE if I go to Verizon.\\n               </p>\\n              </div>\\n              <a aria-controls=\"review-entry-8234963\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse=\\'{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-8234963\"]}\\' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-8234963-btn\">\\n               Read full review\\n              </a>\\n             </div>\\n             <div class=\"rvw-foot\">\\n              <div class=\"rvw-foot__fdbck js-helpful-link hidden-no-js\" data-track-goal=\"profile:helpful_usr_acq_btn:click\" data-uapi-event=\\'{\"element\": \"review_helpful\", \"action\": \"yes\", \"context\": { \"review id\": \"8234963\" }}\\' data-uapi-event-name=\"helpful\">\\n               <input name=\"helpful\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"helpful\"/>\\n               <label for=\"helpful\">\\n                <svg height=\"14\" viewbox=\"0 0 15 14\" width=\"15\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\\n                 <path class=\"ca-icon__colored-fill\" d=\"M14.903 8.356c-.019-.445-.237-.794-.417-1.008.209-.474.29-1.22-.407-1.8-.51-.425-1.375-.615-2.575-.562-.843.035-1.548.178-1.577.184a12.73 12.73 0 0 0-.507.094c-.013-.187.023-.653.401-1.701.449-1.247.423-2.202-.083-2.84C9.206.053 8.356 0 8.106 0a.84.84 0 0 0-.62.258c-.355.377-.313 1.074-.269 1.396-.423 1.037-1.609 3.578-2.613 4.283-.019.012-.035.027-.05.041a3.136 3.136 0 0 0-.63.861 1.425 1.425 0 0 0-.634-.146H1.334C.596 6.693 0 7.24 0 7.91v4.757c0 .673.6 1.218 1.334 1.218H3.29c.285 0 .551-.082.77-.223l.753.082c.115.015 2.167.252 4.274.214.381.026.74.041 1.074.041.574 0 1.074-.04 1.491-.123.981-.19 1.651-.57 1.991-1.13.26-.427.26-.852.218-1.121.638-.527.75-1.11.728-1.52a1.832 1.832 0 0 0-.131-.588c.314-.366.465-.758.445-1.162z\" fill=\"#3E3D3F\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\">\\n                 </path>\\n                </svg>\\n                Helpful\\n               </label>\\n              </div>\\n              <span class=\"rvw-foot__helpful-count js-helpful-count\">\\n               <strong>\\n                17 people\\n               </strong>\\n               found this review helpful\\n              </span>\\n             </div>\\n            </div>\\n            <div class=\"rvw js-rvw\" data-id=\"8233148\" id=\"review-8233148\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\n             <div class=\"rvw__hdr\">\\n              <div class=\"rvw__hdr-stat\" itemprop=\"reviewRating\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Rating\">\\n               <meta content=\"1\" itemprop=\"worstRating\"/>\\n               <img alt=\"Rated with 1 star\" class=\"stars-rtg stars-rtg--sm\" data-rating=\"1.0\" src=\"//media.consumeraffairs.com/static/img/icons/stars/ca-stars-1.86dfada66e1f.svg\"/>\\n               <meta content=\"1\" itemprop=\"ratingValue\"/>\\n               <meta content=\"5\" itemprop=\"bestRating\"/>\\n              </div>\\n             </div>\\n             <div class=\"rvw-aut\">\\n              <div class=\"rvw__pic rvw__pic--no-pic\">\\n              </div>\\n              <div class=\"rvw-aut__inf\">\\n               <strong class=\"rvw-aut__inf-nm\" itemprop=\"author\">\\n                Jeannie of Mineral Bluff, GA\\n               </strong>\\n               <strong class=\"rvw-aut__inf-ver\">\\n                <svg height=\"7\" viewbox=\"0 0 9 7\" width=\"9\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\\n                 <path class=\"ca-icon__colored-fill\" d=\"M4.04 4.36l-1.225.114.568-.536.657.421zM7.27.271a1 1 0 0 1 1.373 1.456L4.187 5.929a1 1 0 0 1-1.226.114l-2.5-1.602A1 1 0 1 1 1.54 2.757l1.843 1.181L7.27.272z\" fill=\"#0E9C3F\" fill-rule=\"nonzero\">\\n                 </path>\\n                </svg>\\n                Verified Reviewer\\n               </strong>\\n              </div>\\n             </div>\\n             <div class=\"rvw-bd\">\\n              <span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">\\n               Original review: Aug. 28, 2020\\n              </span>\\n              <p>\\n              </p>\\n              <p>\\n               Sales rep advised that there were 2 bars of cell service in my location vs. the 1 bar I had with AT&amp;T. I switched because of this and bought 2 new phones with credits for return of old phones from T-Mobile. When I got the phones, there were no bars and no service within a 20 mile radius of my home. I called and and they advised there was no service in my area and no eta on if the tower would be fixed. They agreed to cancel my service and give me the agreed credit for my old phones which I could pay in full and I would owe no more so I paid 300.00 plus for the phones to keep them. They told me to wait to cancel So I did. I received a call that I could port my numbers back to AT&amp;T. Then I received a bill For almost 1000.00.\\n              </p>\\n              <div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-8233148-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-8233148\">\\n               <p>\\n                A supervisor called me and advised that I had to pay monthly and the amount was more than originally agreed on by 100.00. I called numerous times and each time was told they would call me back and no one ever did. 1 person called to tell me she would call again the next day And didn’t call me. I paid for 2 months service and had no ability to make calls so I lost 140.00. I am going to pay 100.00 more than agreed for 2 phones. I lost all my discounts with AT&amp;T and my bill is now 25.00 more per month than before. This whole ordeal cost me thousands of dollars and I am on a fixed income. They lied to me over and over and will do nothing to make it right.\\n               </p>\\n              </div>\\n              <a aria-controls=\"review-entry-8233148\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse=\\'{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-8233148\"]}\\' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-8233148-btn\">\\n               Read full review\\n              </a>\\n             </div>\\n             <div class=\"rvw-foot\">\\n              <div class=\"rvw-foot__fdbck js-helpful-link hidden-no-js\" data-track-goal=\"profile:helpful_usr_acq_btn:click\" data-uapi-event=\\'{\"element\": \"review_helpful\", \"action\": \"yes\", \"context\": { \"review id\": \"8233148\" }}\\' data-uapi-event-name=\"helpful\">\\n               <input name=\"helpful\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"helpful\"/>\\n               <label for=\"helpful\">\\n                <svg height=\"14\" viewbox=\"0 0 15 14\" width=\"15\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\\n                 <path class=\"ca-icon__colored-fill\" d=\"M14.903 8.356c-.019-.445-.237-.794-.417-1.008.209-.474.29-1.22-.407-1.8-.51-.425-1.375-.615-2.575-.562-.843.035-1.548.178-1.577.184a12.73 12.73 0 0 0-.507.094c-.013-.187.023-.653.401-1.701.449-1.247.423-2.202-.083-2.84C9.206.053 8.356 0 8.106 0a.84.84 0 0 0-.62.258c-.355.377-.313 1.074-.269 1.396-.423 1.037-1.609 3.578-2.613 4.283-.019.012-.035.027-.05.041a3.136 3.136 0 0 0-.63.861 1.425 1.425 0 0 0-.634-.146H1.334C.596 6.693 0 7.24 0 7.91v4.757c0 .673.6 1.218 1.334 1.218H3.29c.285 0 .551-.082.77-.223l.753.082c.115.015 2.167.252 4.274.214.381.026.74.041 1.074.041.574 0 1.074-.04 1.491-.123.981-.19 1.651-.57 1.991-1.13.26-.427.26-.852.218-1.121.638-.527.75-1.11.728-1.52a1.832 1.832 0 0 0-.131-.588c.314-.366.465-.758.445-1.162z\" fill=\"#3E3D3F\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\">\\n                 </path>\\n                </svg>\\n                Helpful\\n               </label>\\n              </div>\\n              <span class=\"rvw-foot__helpful-count js-helpful-count\">\\n               <strong>\\n                14 people\\n               </strong>\\n               found this review helpful\\n              </span>\\n             </div>\\n            </div>\\n            <div class=\"rvw js-rvw\" data-id=\"8210141\" id=\"review-8210141\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\n             <div class=\"rvw__hdr\">\\n              <div class=\"rvw__hdr-stat\" itemprop=\"reviewRating\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Rating\">\\n               <meta content=\"1\" itemprop=\"worstRating\"/>\\n               <img alt=\"Rated with 1 star\" class=\"stars-rtg stars-rtg--sm\" data-rating=\"1.0\" src=\"//media.consumeraffairs.com/static/img/icons/stars/ca-stars-1.86dfada66e1f.svg\"/>\\n               <meta content=\"1\" itemprop=\"ratingValue\"/>\\n               <meta content=\"5\" itemprop=\"bestRating\"/>\\n              </div>\\n             </div>\\n             <div class=\"rvw-aut\">\\n              <div class=\"rvw__pic rvw__pic--no-pic\">\\n              </div>\\n              <div class=\"rvw-aut__inf\">\\n               <strong class=\"rvw-aut__inf-nm\" itemprop=\"author\">\\n                Charles of Loganville, GA\\n               </strong>\\n               <strong class=\"rvw-aut__inf-ver\">\\n                <svg height=\"7\" viewbox=\"0 0 9 7\" width=\"9\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\\n                 <path class=\"ca-icon__colored-fill\" d=\"M4.04 4.36l-1.225.114.568-.536.657.421zM7.27.271a1 1 0 0 1 1.373 1.456L4.187 5.929a1 1 0 0 1-1.226.114l-2.5-1.602A1 1 0 1 1 1.54 2.757l1.843 1.181L7.27.272z\" fill=\"#0E9C3F\" fill-rule=\"nonzero\">\\n                 </path>\\n                </svg>\\n                Verified Reviewer\\n               </strong>\\n              </div>\\n             </div>\\n             <div class=\"rvw-bd\">\\n              <span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">\\n               Original review: Aug. 25, 2020\\n              </span>\\n              <p>\\n              </p>\\n              <p>\\n               T-Mobile recently \"upgraded\" their network within 10 miles of my home to 5G rendering my 4G phone worthless!

Good service and customer service, only problem was a trade in, I got the Note 20 Ultra but I also have the Note 9 128 gb and Note 10+ 512gb so for the trade in the Note 9 it said must pay balance of $30.87 which is the Note 9 and I paid it. Now it say for me to send in the note 10+ 512 gb for only $379.00 not even the $500 they advertised. I called 2 and now they want me when I receive the note 20 to send it back, ask for refund and then to reordered the note 20 to put the right phone for trade in, after I paid everything and wait about 3 weeks. I\\'m thinking about getting another note 20 ultra but this time getting it from Samsung and get more money back from trade in. Their mistake but I have to pay for it.

So over Tmobile and their now hidden penalties and charges. Had a digit line I no longer needed and wanted to deactivate it. Line was 5.00 but was paying 10.00 because I won\\'t give tmobile access to my bank account. When canceling was told I would be penalized on a tablet promotion I added after the digits line. Last month I ordered their internet service but had not unboxed or hooked up the equipment. Was told with the internet no contract, no penalties for cancellation. Now I\\'m told if I cancelled the internet I would be penalized on the tablet promotion and they could not take the tablet back because of buyers remorse. Who brought that up buyers remorse?\\n              </p>\\n              <div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-8175830-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-8175830\">\\n               <p>\\n                Needless to say I\\'m over the top that canceling a 10.00 line that tmobile is already making 5.00 on because I won\\'t let them in my bank account has gone to this level. My account has a credit of over 500.00. I have never paid my bill late and at the time I had 6 lines with Tmobile. And now for the final act...cancel internet 55.00, cancel tablet 1, 25.00, cancel tablet 25.00 cancel digits line 10.00, cancel insurance and jump 16.00. I have 2 lines left with Tmobile for now...Within 30 days I\\'ll have that canceled too.\\n               </p>\\n               <p>\\n                So Tmobile penalizes me for canceling a 10.00 digits and now they\\'ve lost income on 4 lines. Which brings me to the Blockbuster comment...Tmobile is making people mad just like Blockbuster did and we know how that story ended...can you say Netflix. Keep it up Tmobile.

After 3 calls they finally removed the charge, but that\\'s after 27 months of paying for something that isn\\'t mine. There were plenty of excuses and every person I spoke to gave me another story.

When you get someone they then have to transfer you.... This takes 20 to 30 minutes and you will get hung up first few tries.... The company has changed.... It does have good prices....but service means everything.... I have a problem with a phone...and tried now 9x to contact a so-called real person non robot.... Wasted 2 hours and still nothing.... It is 7 pm at night.... Maybe they close down ,,,,,\\n              </p>\\n             </div>\\n             <div class=\"rvw-foot\">\\n              <div class=\"rvw-foot__fdbck js-helpful-link hidden-no-js\" data-track-goal=\"profile:helpful_usr_acq_btn:click\" data-uapi-event=\\'{\"element\": \"review_helpful\", \"action\": \"yes\", \"context\": { \"review id\": \"8156957\" }}\\' data-uapi-event-name=\"helpful\">\\n               <input name=\"helpful\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"helpful\"/>\\n               <label for=\"helpful\">\\n                <svg height=\"14\" viewbox=\"0 0 15 14\" width=\"15\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\\n                 <path class=\"ca-icon__colored-fill\" d=\"M14.903 8.356c-.019-.445-.237-.794-.417-1.008.209-.474.29-1.22-.407-1.8-.51-.425-1.375-.615-2.575-.562-.843.035-1.548.178-1.577.184a12.73 12.73 0 0 0-.507.094c-.013-.187.023-.653.401-1.701.449-1.247.423-2.202-.083-2.84C9.206.053 8.356 0 8.106 0a.84.84 0 0 0-.62.258c-.355.377-.313 1.074-.269 1.396-.423 1.037-1.609 3.578-2.613 4.283-.019.012-.035.027-.05.041a3.136 3.136 0 0 0-.63.861 1.425 1.425 0 0 0-.634-.146H1.334C.596 6.693 0 7.24 0 7.91v4.757c0 .673.6 1.218 1.334 1.218H3.29c.285 0 .551-.082.77-.223l.753.082c.115.015 2.167.252 4.274.214.381.026.74.041 1.074.041.574 0 1.074-.04 1.491-.123.981-.19 1.651-.57 1.991-1.13.26-.427.26-.852.218-1.121.638-.527.75-1.11.728-1.52a1.832 1.832 0 0 0-.131-.588c.314-.366.465-.758.445-1.162z\" fill=\"#3E3D3F\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\">\\n                 </path>\\n                </svg>\\n                Helpful\\n               </label>\\n              </div>\\n              <span class=\"rvw-foot__helpful-count js-helpful-count\">\\n               <strong>\\n                22 people\\n               </strong>\\n               found this review helpful\\n              </span>\\n             </div>\\n            </div>\\n            <div class=\"rvw js-rvw\" data-id=\"8152463\" id=\"review-8152463\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\n             <div class=\"rvw__hdr\">\\n              <div class=\"rvw__hdr-stat\" itemprop=\"reviewRating\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Rating\">\\n               <meta content=\"1\" itemprop=\"worstRating\"/>\\n               <img alt=\"Rated with 1 star\" class=\"stars-rtg stars-rtg--sm\" data-rating=\"1.0\" src=\"//media.consumeraffairs.com/static/img/icons/stars/ca-stars-1.86dfada66e1f.svg\"/>\\n               <meta content=\"1\" itemprop=\"ratingValue\"/>\\n               <meta content=\"5\" itemprop=\"bestRating\"/>\\n              </div>\\n             </div>\\n             <div class=\"rvw-aut\">\\n              <div class=\"rvw__pic rvw__pic--no-pic\">\\n              </div>\\n              <div class=\"rvw-aut__inf\">\\n               <strong class=\"rvw-aut__inf-nm\" itemprop=\"author\">\\n                Tanya of Orlando, FL\\n               </strong>\\n               <strong class=\"rvw-aut__inf-ver\">\\n                <svg height=\"7\" viewbox=\"0 0 9 7\" width=\"9\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\\n                 <path class=\"ca-icon__colored-fill\" d=\"M4.04 4.36l-1.225.114.568-.536.657.421zM7.27.271a1 1 0 0 1 1.373 1.456L4.187 5.929a1 1 0 0 1-1.226.114l-2.5-1.602A1 1 0 1 1 1.54 2.757l1.843 1.181L7.27.272z\" fill=\"#0E9C3F\" fill-rule=\"nonzero\">\\n                 </path>\\n                </svg>\\n                Verified Reviewer\\n               </strong>\\n              </div>\\n             </div>\\n             <div class=\"rvw-bd\">\\n              <span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">\\n               Original review: Aug. 4, 2020\\n              </span>\\n              <p>\\n              </p>\\n              <p>\\n               If I could give a ZERO Star rating I would. I\\'m extremely upset by my experience today (August 4th). Myself and another customer waited for the store to open at 10:00. You could tell the air conditioner had not kicked in yet. It was warm. One employee began to help the other customer and she (the employee) had her mask under her chin because she was hot and proceeded to talk and engage with the customer. The other employee helped me. She had her mask on. Another female employee came from the back with no mask on and proceeded to talk to the employee with the mask under her neck with the customer between them barely 1 foot between the 2 of them.\\n              </p>\\n              <div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-8152463-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-8152463\">\\n               <p>\\n                I couldn\\'t restrain myself another second. I said... \"You really need to have a mask on.\" And she said, \"I\\'m leaving but I need to tell her something.\" I reminded her that the sign on the door said employees and customers are REQUIRED to wear a mask while in the store. She again said she was leaving. I let her know she was talking without a mask a foot away from a customer and she said, \"Well he has on a mark.\" I later found out she was the Assistant Manager of this store on Apopka Vineland Road. I have not been around my own family without a mask but I\\'m going to be put at risk at my local T-Mobile store.\\n               </p>\\n              </div>\\n              <a aria-controls=\"review-entry-8152463\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse=\\'{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-8152463\"]}\\' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-8152463-btn\">\\n               Read full review\\n              </a>\\n             </div>\\n             <div class=\"rvw-foot\">\\n              <div class=\"rvw-foot__fdbck js-helpful-link hidden-no-js\" data-track-goal=\"profile:helpful_usr_acq_btn:click\" data-uapi-event=\\'{\"element\": \"review_helpful\", \"action\": \"yes\", \"context\": { \"review id\": \"8152463\" }}\\' data-uapi-event-name=\"helpful\">\\n               <input name=\"helpful\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"helpful\"/>\\n               <label for=\"helpful\">\\n                <svg height=\"14\" viewbox=\"0 0 15 14\" width=\"15\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\\n                 <path class=\"ca-icon__colored-fill\" d=\"M14.903 8.356c-.019-.445-.237-.794-.417-1.008.209-.474.29-1.22-.407-1.8-.51-.425-1.375-.615-2.575-.562-.843.035-1.548.178-1.577.184a12.73 12.73 0 0 0-.507.094c-.013-.187.023-.653.401-1.701.449-1.247.423-2.202-.083-2.84C9.206.053 8.356 0 8.106 0a.84.84 0 0 0-.62.258c-.355.377-.313 1.074-.269 1.396-.423 1.037-1.609 3.578-2.613 4.283-.019.012-.035.027-.05.041a3.136 3.136 0 0 0-.63.861 1.425 1.425 0 0 0-.634-.146H1.334C.596 6.693 0 7.24 0 7.91v4.757c0 .673.6 1.218 1.334 1.218H3.29c.285 0 .551-.082.77-.223l.753.082c.115.015 2.167.252 4.274.214.381.026.74.041 1.074.041.574 0 1.074-.04 1.491-.123.981-.19 1.651-.57 1.991-1.13.26-.427.26-.852.218-1.121.638-.527.75-1.11.728-1.52a1.832 1.832 0 0 0-.131-.588c.314-.366.465-.758.445-1.162z\" fill=\"#3E3D3F\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\">\\n                 </path>\\n                </svg>\\n                Helpful\\n               </label>\\n              </div>\\n              <span class=\"rvw-foot__helpful-count js-helpful-count\">\\n               <strong>\\n                18 people\\n               </strong>\\n               found this review helpful\\n              </span>\\n             </div>\\n            </div>\\n            <div class=\"rvw js-rvw\" data-id=\"8151071\" id=\"review-8151071\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\n             <div class=\"rvw__hdr\">\\n              <div class=\"rvw__hdr-stat\" itemprop=\"reviewRating\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Rating\">\\n               <meta content=\"1\" itemprop=\"worstRating\"/>\\n               <img alt=\"Rated with 1 star\" class=\"stars-rtg stars-rtg--sm\" data-rating=\"1.0\" src=\"//media.consumeraffairs.com/static/img/icons/stars/ca-stars-1.86dfada66e1f.svg\"/>\\n               <meta content=\"1\" itemprop=\"ratingValue\"/>\\n               <meta content=\"5\" itemprop=\"bestRating\"/>\\n              </div>\\n             </div>\\n             <div class=\"rvw-aut\">\\n              <img alt=\"profile pic of the author\" class=\"rvw__pic lazy-load fadein\" data-src=\"https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/cache/profile-photos/photo_945611_head_shot_micro.jpg\" height=\"50\" width=\"50\"/>\\n              <div class=\"rvw-aut__inf\">\\n               <strong class=\"rvw-aut__inf-nm\" itemprop=\"author\">\\n                Gabriel of Pittsburgh, PA\\n               </strong>\\n               <strong class=\"rvw-aut__inf-ver\">\\n                <svg height=\"7\" viewbox=\"0 0 9 7\" width=\"9\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\\n                 <path class=\"ca-icon__colored-fill\" d=\"M4.04 4.36l-1.225.114.568-.536.657.421zM7.27.271a1 1 0 0 1 1.373 1.456L4.187 5.929a1 1 0 0 1-1.226.114l-2.5-1.602A1 1 0 1 1 1.54 2.757l1.843 1.181L7.27.272z\" fill=\"#0E9C3F\" fill-rule=\"nonzero\">\\n                 </path>\\n                </svg>\\n                Verified Reviewer\\n               </strong>\\n              </div>\\n             </div>\\n             <div class=\"rvw-bd\">\\n              <span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">\\n               Original review: Aug. 4, 2020\\n              </span>\\n              <p>\\n              </p>\\n              <p>\\n               T-Mobile is horrible.

Thank you for charging me for services I never used, could not use, and refusing to close my account till I go risk my health and safety due to your representative\\'s error when she put my PIN# in. Terrible terrible Company when all they care about is the $70.00 a month from my account and not my own health and safety.\\n              </p>\\n             </div>\\n             <div class=\"rvw-foot\">\\n              <div class=\"rvw-foot__fdbck js-helpful-link hidden-no-js\" data-track-goal=\"profile:helpful_usr_acq_btn:click\" data-uapi-event=\\'{\"element\": \"review_helpful\", \"action\": \"yes\", \"context\": { \"review id\": \"8149907\" }}\\' data-uapi-event-name=\"helpful\">\\n               <input name=\"helpful\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"helpful\"/>\\n               <label for=\"helpful\">\\n                <svg height=\"14\" viewbox=\"0 0 15 14\" width=\"15\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\\n                 <path class=\"ca-icon__colored-fill\" d=\"M14.903 8.356c-.019-.445-.237-.794-.417-1.008.209-.474.29-1.22-.407-1.8-.51-.425-1.375-.615-2.575-.562-.843.035-1.548.178-1.577.184a12.73 12.73 0 0 0-.507.094c-.013-.187.023-.653.401-1.701.449-1.247.423-2.202-.083-2.84C9.206.053 8.356 0 8.106 0a.84.84 0 0 0-.62.258c-.355.377-.313 1.074-.269 1.396-.423 1.037-1.609 3.578-2.613 4.283-.019.012-.035.027-.05.041a3.136 3.136 0 0 0-.63.861 1.425 1.425 0 0 0-.634-.146H1.334C.596 6.693 0 7.24 0 7.91v4.757c0 .673.6 1.218 1.334 1.218H3.29c.285 0 .551-.082.77-.223l.753.082c.115.015 2.167.252 4.274.214.381.026.74.041 1.074.041.574 0 1.074-.04 1.491-.123.981-.19 1.651-.57 1.991-1.13.26-.427.26-.852.218-1.121.638-.527.75-1.11.728-1.52a1.832 1.832 0 0 0-.131-.588c.314-.366.465-.758.445-1.162z\" fill=\"#3E3D3F\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\">\\n                 </path>\\n                </svg>\\n                Helpful\\n               </label>\\n              </div>\\n              <span class=\"rvw-foot__helpful-count js-helpful-count\">\\n               <strong>\\n                21 people\\n               </strong>\\n               found this review helpful\\n              </span>\\n             </div>\\n            </div>\\n            <div class=\"rvw js-rvw\" data-id=\"8146943\" id=\"review-8146943\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\n             <div class=\"rvw__hdr\">\\n              <div class=\"rvw__hdr-stat\" itemprop=\"reviewRating\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Rating\">\\n               <meta content=\"1\" itemprop=\"worstRating\"/>\\n               <img alt=\"Rated with 1 star\" class=\"stars-rtg stars-rtg--sm\" data-rating=\"1.0\" src=\"//media.consumeraffairs.com/static/img/icons/stars/ca-stars-1.86dfada66e1f.svg\"/>\\n               <meta content=\"1\" itemprop=\"ratingValue\"/>\\n               <meta content=\"5\" itemprop=\"bestRating\"/>\\n              </div>\\n             </div>\\n             <div class=\"rvw-aut\">\\n              <div class=\"rvw__pic rvw__pic--no-pic\">\\n              </div>\\n              <div class=\"rvw-aut__inf\">\\n               <strong class=\"rvw-aut__inf-nm\" itemprop=\"author\">\\n                Wayne of Phoenix, AZ\\n               </strong>\\n               <strong class=\"rvw-aut__inf-ver\">\\n                <svg height=\"7\" viewbox=\"0 0 9 7\" width=\"9\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\\n                 <path class=\"ca-icon__colored-fill\" d=\"M4.04 4.36l-1.225.114.568-.536.657.421zM7.27.271a1 1 0 0 1 1.373 1.456L4.187 5.929a1 1 0 0 1-1.226.114l-2.5-1.602A1 1 0 1 1 1.54 2.757l1.843 1.181L7.27.272z\" fill=\"#0E9C3F\" fill-rule=\"nonzero\">\\n                 </path>\\n                </svg>\\n                Verified Reviewer\\n               </strong>\\n              </div>\\n             </div>\\n             <div class=\"rvw-bd\">\\n              <span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">\\n               Original review: Aug. 3, 2020\\n              </span>\\n              <p>\\n              </p>\\n              <p>\\n               We had a very unusual problem with T-Mobile, and in the end we hate T-Mobile. Between July 10 &amp; July 15 all T-Mobile customers throughout the U.S. and possibly Canada and Mexico who had the old workhorse Note 4s had NO SERVICE!! T-Mobile was updating their lines, and we discovered they were trying to BOUNCE off the old phones off their network to make way progress for their supposedly better network. We were one of their most unusual cases because we have 2 accounts with 3 lines on each account, and of those 6 phone lines, we had 5 excellent working Note 4s until Friday, July 10th when we woke up with NO SERVICE!! I spent several hours with their top tech (EXPERT), and he was bewildered, and he had no clue what was going on. The next day, Saturday, another t-mobile (EXPERT) tried.\\n              </p>\\n              <div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-8146943-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-8146943\">\\n               <p>\\n                It was obvious that T-Mobile did something with their network. One t-mobile (EXPERT TECH) swore up and down it was the phone, and the other t-mobile (EXPERT) said he was certain it was the t-mobile network. When I asked for compensation, it was a BIG TO DO!! I was bounced around from representative to represent from TEAM to TEAM all over the country, and finally settled with a calm, but very slick (PERFECT T-MOBILE SOLDIER)!! She was very tricky, dicky, sneaky, and dishonest!! We are getting compensation with different phones, but this (PERFECT T-MOBILE SOLDIER) tricked us into getting lesser compensation. There\\'s much more to the story, and maybe later I will finish it, but I will say without a doubt, T-MOBILE is a HORRIBLE COMPANY, and PLEASE STAY AWAY From them!!!\\n               </p>\\n              </div>\\n              <a aria-controls=\"review-entry-8146943\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse=\\'{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-8146943\"]}\\' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-8146943-btn\">\\n               Read full review\\n              </a>\\n             </div>\\n             <div class=\"rvw-foot\">\\n              <div class=\"rvw-foot__fdbck js-helpful-link hidden-no-js\" data-track-goal=\"profile:helpful_usr_acq_btn:click\" data-uapi-event=\\'{\"element\": \"review_helpful\", \"action\": \"yes\", \"context\": { \"review id\": \"8146943\" }}\\' data-uapi-event-name=\"helpful\">\\n               <input name=\"helpful\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"helpful\"/>\\n               <label for=\"helpful\">\\n                <svg height=\"14\" viewbox=\"0 0 15 14\" width=\"15\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\\n                 <path class=\"ca-icon__colored-fill\" d=\"M14.903 8.356c-.019-.445-.237-.794-.417-1.008.209-.474.29-1.22-.407-1.8-.51-.425-1.375-.615-2.575-.562-.843.035-1.548.178-1.577.184a12.73 12.73 0 0 0-.507.094c-.013-.187.023-.653.401-1.701.449-1.247.423-2.202-.083-2.84C9.206.053 8.356 0 8.106 0a.84.84 0 0 0-.62.258c-.355.377-.313 1.074-.269 1.396-.423 1.037-1.609 3.578-2.613 4.283-.019.012-.035.027-.05.041a3.136 3.136 0 0 0-.63.861 1.425 1.425 0 0 0-.634-.146H1.334C.596 6.693 0 7.24 0 7.91v4.757c0 .673.6 1.218 1.334 1.218H3.29c.285 0 .551-.082.77-.223l.753.082c.115.015 2.167.252 4.274.214.381.026.74.041 1.074.041.574 0 1.074-.04 1.491-.123.981-.19 1.651-.57 1.991-1.13.26-.427.26-.852.218-1.121.638-.527.75-1.11.728-1.52a1.832 1.832 0 0 0-.131-.588c.314-.366.465-.758.445-1.162z\" fill=\"#3E3D3F\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\">\\n                 </path>\\n                </svg>\\n                Helpful\\n               </label>\\n              </div>\\n              <span class=\"rvw-foot__helpful-count js-helpful-count\">\\n               <strong>\\n                15 people\\n               </strong>\\n               found this review helpful\\n              </span>\\n             </div>\\n            </div>\\n            <div class=\"rvw js-rvw\" data-id=\"8146805\" id=\"review-8146805\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\n             <div class=\"rvw__hdr\">\\n              <div class=\"rvw__hdr-stat\" itemprop=\"reviewRating\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Rating\">\\n               <meta content=\"1\" itemprop=\"worstRating\"/>\\n               <img alt=\"Rated with 1 star\" class=\"stars-rtg stars-rtg--sm\" data-rating=\"1.0\" src=\"//media.consumeraffairs.com/static/img/icons/stars/ca-stars-1.86dfada66e1f.svg\"/>\\n               <meta content=\"1\" itemprop=\"ratingValue\"/>\\n               <meta content=\"5\" itemprop=\"bestRating\"/>\\n              </div>\\n             </div>\\n             <div class=\"rvw-aut\">\\n              <img alt=\"profile pic of the author\" class=\"rvw__pic lazy-load fadein\" data-src=\"https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/cache/profile-photos/photo_313183_head_shot_micro.jpg\" height=\"50\" width=\"50\"/>\\n              <div class=\"rvw-aut__inf\">\\n               <strong class=\"rvw-aut__inf-nm\" itemprop=\"author\">\\n                george of Dallas, TX\\n               </strong>\\n               <strong class=\"rvw-aut__inf-ver\">\\n                <svg height=\"7\" viewbox=\"0 0 9 7\" width=\"9\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\\n                 <path class=\"ca-icon__colored-fill\" d=\"M4.04 4.36l-1.225.114.568-.536.657.421zM7.27.271a1 1 0 0 1 1.373 1.456L4.187 5.929a1 1 0 0 1-1.226.114l-2.5-1.602A1 1 0 1 1 1.54 2.757l1.843 1.181L7.27.272z\" fill=\"#0E9C3F\" fill-rule=\"nonzero\">\\n                 </path>\\n                </svg>\\n                Verified Reviewer\\n               </strong>\\n              </div>\\n             </div>\\n             <div class=\"rvw-bd\">\\n              <span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">\\n               Original review: Aug. 3, 2020\\n              </span>\\n              <p>\\n              </p>\\n              <p>\\n               I don\\'t have much complaints for the the 15 year I\\'ve been with them 2002-2015 and 2018 till now, but I have noticed twice so far that they literally make up false charges on your account, especially when you are signed up for a automatic payment withdrawal every month. And if you don\\'t carefully watch what\\'s going on, you will miss and they will keep on stealing from the millions of clients they have. This month it was $30, next month could be $3 but it still a theft. This month I was charged $138 instead of the $109 I am supposed to pay. I immediately noticed and called to see what\\'s going on and I was informed that they did some changes on my account (unauthorized of course, and without my knowledge) and this is why my bill was $30 extra.\\n              </p>\\n              <div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-8146805-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-8146805\">\\n               <p>\\n                They apologized and issued a credit,. This is the second time I caught them cheating by making up false charges and they always apologize and refund them. But the only reason I noticed was because both times was amounts over $20. If it was something like $5-$10, I\\'d never noticed. This is a SCAM, a theft, Be careful with them! Always watch your bills. If I catch them once again, I am done for good with them.\\n               </p>\\n              </div>\\n              <a aria-controls=\"review-entry-8146805\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse=\\'{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-8146805\"]}\\' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-8146805-btn\">\\n               Read full review\\n              </a>\\n             </div>\\n             <div class=\"rvw-foot\">\\n              <div class=\"rvw-foot__fdbck js-helpful-link hidden-no-js\" data-track-goal=\"profile:helpful_usr_acq_btn:click\" data-uapi-event=\\'{\"element\": \"review_helpful\", \"action\": \"yes\", \"context\": { \"review id\": \"8146805\" }}\\' data-uapi-event-name=\"helpful\">\\n               <input name=\"helpful\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"helpful\"/>\\n               <label for=\"helpful\">\\n                <svg height=\"14\" viewbox=\"0 0 15 14\" width=\"15\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\\n                 <path class=\"ca-icon__colored-fill\" d=\"M14.903 8.356c-.019-.445-.237-.794-.417-1.008.209-.474.29-1.22-.407-1.8-.51-.425-1.375-.615-2.575-.562-.843.035-1.548.178-1.577.184a12.73 12.73 0 0 0-.507.094c-.013-.187.023-.653.401-1.701.449-1.247.423-2.202-.083-2.84C9.206.053 8.356 0 8.106 0a.84.84 0 0 0-.62.258c-.355.377-.313 1.074-.269 1.396-.423 1.037-1.609 3.578-2.613 4.283-.019.012-.035.027-.05.041a3.136 3.136 0 0 0-.63.861 1.425 1.425 0 0 0-.634-.146H1.334C.596 6.693 0 7.24 0 7.91v4.757c0 .673.6 1.218 1.334 1.218H3.29c.285 0 .551-.082.77-.223l.753.082c.115.015 2.167.252 4.274.214.381.026.74.041 1.074.041.574 0 1.074-.04 1.491-.123.981-.19 1.651-.57 1.991-1.13.26-.427.26-.852.218-1.121.638-.527.75-1.11.728-1.52a1.832 1.832 0 0 0-.131-.588c.314-.366.465-.758.445-1.162z\" fill=\"#3E3D3F\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\">\\n                 </path>\\n                </svg>\\n                Helpful\\n               </label>\\n              </div>\\n              <span class=\"rvw-foot__helpful-count js-helpful-count\">\\n               <strong>\\n                16 people\\n               </strong>\\n               found this review helpful\\n              </span>\\n             </div>\\n            </div>\\n            <div class=\"rvw js-rvw\" data-id=\"8131769\" id=\"review-8131769\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\n             <div class=\"rvw__hdr\">\\n              <div class=\"rvw__hdr-stat\" itemprop=\"reviewRating\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Rating\">\\n               <meta content=\"1\" itemprop=\"worstRating\"/>\\n               <img alt=\"Rated with 1 star\" class=\"stars-rtg stars-rtg--sm\" data-rating=\"1.0\" src=\"//media.consumeraffairs.com/static/img/icons/stars/ca-stars-1.86dfada66e1f.svg\"/>\\n               <meta content=\"1\" itemprop=\"ratingValue\"/>\\n               <meta content=\"5\" itemprop=\"bestRating\"/>\\n              </div>\\n             </div>\\n             <div class=\"rvw-aut\">\\n              <img alt=\"profile pic of the author\" class=\"rvw__pic lazy-load fadein\" data-src=\"https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/cache/profile-photos/photo_941690_head_shot_micro.jpg\" height=\"50\" width=\"50\"/>\\n              <div class=\"rvw-aut__inf\">\\n               <strong class=\"rvw-aut__inf-nm\" itemprop=\"author\">\\n                CA of Sacramento, CA\\n               </strong>\\n               <strong class=\"rvw-aut__inf-ver\">\\n                <svg height=\"7\" viewbox=\"0 0 9 7\" width=\"9\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\\n                 <path class=\"ca-icon__colored-fill\" d=\"M4.04 4.36l-1.225.114.568-.536.657.421zM7.27.271a1 1 0 0 1 1.373 1.456L4.187 5.929a1 1 0 0 1-1.226.114l-2.5-1.602A1 1 0 1 1 1.54 2.757l1.843 1.181L7.27.272z\" fill=\"#0E9C3F\" fill-rule=\"nonzero\">\\n                 </path>\\n                </svg>\\n                Verified Reviewer\\n               </strong>\\n              </div>\\n             </div>\\n             <div class=\"rvw-bd\">\\n              <span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">\\n               Original review: July 28, 2020\\n              </span>\\n              <p>\\n              </p>\\n              <p>\\n               T-mobile does not have a plan that includes free conference calling!

Lines for My Business And I have been with T Mobile about 4 years. Before COVID-19 pandemic start I called them and I request my business stopped running and I asked them, \"Should I freeze or canceled line?\" They give me about Time and hold collection.

Want to talk supervisor several times. They didn’t get back to me. Finally they called me and pay some amount. We going to keep your service for 2 weeks ETC. Finals I don’t have any phone line about 2 days so If you running business you have to work company when you have hard time have to share your hard time with you. After 4 years fee bill couldn’t pay they don’t even want to service to you. Make sure your money goes to right place.

I would receive text messages hours after they had been sent. Internet was constantly being throttled to lower speeds. So, I decided to port my number to mint mobile and not continue my service with tmobile. I contacted tmobile and asked what I needed to do to port my number. I was told that my account was in good standing, service would end on July 5th &amp; I was given my account number &amp; pin.\\n              </p>\\n              <div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-8080376-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-8080376\">\\n               <p>\\n                Today July 9th I attempted to port my phone number to Mint and it wouldn\\'t go through. So, I called tmobile and the rep said that they can\\'t port a number from a deactivated phone (this is a lie) &amp; I would have to pay $75 plus a reactivation fee. I refused &amp; after her speaking with her manager she agreed to turn my service back on for free so I could port the number. I call back Mint, the number still won\\'t port. I call tmobile, the new rep tells me that I cannot port a number until I pay the current balance of $77 for the cycle beginning July 5th. I explain that it is impossible for me to have a remaining balance because I pay month to month &amp; my service ended on July 5th in good standing.\\n               </p>\\n               <p>\\n                After a long hold he gets back on &amp; says the past due amount is actually from January. I explain again, that I pay month to month, at no time has tmobile said that I had a past due balance &amp; I was specifically told that my account was in good standing. Another long hold, he comes back &amp; says the charge is actually from February. I disagree. His manager comes on &amp; explains the charge is actually due July 24th. I again explain that I don\\'t want service, I have always paid upfront for service on a month to month basis meaning that a payment due on July 24th would provide me with service into August. He puts me on hold. At this point I begin to question why I have been given 5 reasons for this mysterious charge. Manager gets back on &amp; says \"oh, I see now, the charge is actually from May\".

Three reps and 2 supervisors, one supervisor hung up on me and nobody else could explain to me why up until this point I\\'ve been able to make conference calls but now you\\'re telling me it wasn\\'t included in my plan and I have to pay $10 more a month to have it added to my plan...\\n              </p>\\n              <div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-8039408-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-8039408\">\\n               <p>\\n                One supervisor told me there was a glitch in the system and now that they\\'re aware of it I won\\'t be able to make the calls anymore unless I pay extra for it.... Full of crap. T-Mobile sees that a lot of people are working from home and found another way to charge their customers more money to do it... Once I find another carrier they will no longer get my money....\\n               </p>\\n              </div>\\n              <a aria-controls=\"review-entry-8039408\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse=\\'{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-8039408\"]}\\' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-8039408-btn\">\\n               Read full review\\n              </a>\\n             </div>\\n             <div class=\"rvw-foot\">\\n              <div class=\"rvw-foot__fdbck js-helpful-link hidden-no-js\" data-track-goal=\"profile:helpful_usr_acq_btn:click\" data-uapi-event=\\'{\"element\": \"review_helpful\", \"action\": \"yes\", \"context\": { \"review id\": \"8039408\" }}\\' data-uapi-event-name=\"helpful\">\\n               <input name=\"helpful\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"helpful\"/>\\n               <label for=\"helpful\">\\n                <svg height=\"14\" viewbox=\"0 0 15 14\" width=\"15\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\\n                 <path class=\"ca-icon__colored-fill\" d=\"M14.903 8.356c-.019-.445-.237-.794-.417-1.008.209-.474.29-1.22-.407-1.8-.51-.425-1.375-.615-2.575-.562-.843.035-1.548.178-1.577.184a12.73 12.73 0 0 0-.507.094c-.013-.187.023-.653.401-1.701.449-1.247.423-2.202-.083-2.84C9.206.053 8.356 0 8.106 0a.84.84 0 0 0-.62.258c-.355.377-.313 1.074-.269 1.396-.423 1.037-1.609 3.578-2.613 4.283-.019.012-.035.027-.05.041a3.136 3.136 0 0 0-.63.861 1.425 1.425 0 0 0-.634-.146H1.334C.596 6.693 0 7.24 0 7.91v4.757c0 .673.6 1.218 1.334 1.218H3.29c.285 0 .551-.082.77-.223l.753.082c.115.015 2.167.252 4.274.214.381.026.74.041 1.074.041.574 0 1.074-.04 1.491-.123.981-.19 1.651-.57 1.991-1.13.26-.427.26-.852.218-1.121.638-.527.75-1.11.728-1.52a1.832 1.832 0 0 0-.131-.588c.314-.366.465-.758.445-1.162z\" fill=\"#3E3D3F\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\">\\n                 </path>\\n                </svg>\\n                Helpful\\n               </label>\\n              </div>\\n              <span class=\"rvw-foot__helpful-count js-helpful-count\">\\n               <strong>\\n                16 people\\n               </strong>\\n               found this review helpful\\n              </span>\\n             </div>\\n            </div>\\n            <div class=\"rvw js-rvw\" data-id=\"8029886\" id=\"review-8029886\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\n             <div class=\"rvw__hdr\">\\n              <div class=\"rvw__hdr-stat\" itemprop=\"reviewRating\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Rating\">\\n               <meta content=\"1\" itemprop=\"worstRating\"/>\\n               <img alt=\"Rated with 1 star\" class=\"stars-rtg stars-rtg--sm\" data-rating=\"1.0\" src=\"//media.consumeraffairs.com/static/img/icons/stars/ca-stars-1.86dfada66e1f.svg\"/>\\n               <meta content=\"1\" itemprop=\"ratingValue\"/>\\n               <meta content=\"5\" itemprop=\"bestRating\"/>\\n              </div>\\n             </div>\\n             <div class=\"rvw-aut\">\\n              <div class=\"rvw__pic rvw__pic--no-pic\">\\n              </div>\\n              <div class=\"rvw-aut__inf\">\\n               <strong class=\"rvw-aut__inf-nm\" itemprop=\"author\">\\n                Ava of Blue Springs, MO\\n               </strong>\\n               <strong class=\"rvw-aut__inf-ver\">\\n                <svg height=\"7\" viewbox=\"0 0 9 7\" width=\"9\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\\n                 <path class=\"ca-icon__colored-fill\" d=\"M4.04 4.36l-1.225.114.568-.536.657.421zM7.27.271a1 1 0 0 1 1.373 1.456L4.187 5.929a1 1 0 0 1-1.226.114l-2.5-1.602A1 1 0 1 1 1.54 2.757l1.843 1.181L7.27.272z\" fill=\"#0E9C3F\" fill-rule=\"nonzero\">\\n                 </path>\\n                </svg>\\n                Verified Reviewer\\n               </strong>\\n              </div>\\n             </div>\\n             <div class=\"rvw-bd\">\\n              <span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">\\n               Original review: June 26, 2020\\n              </span>\\n              <p>\\n              </p>\\n              <p>\\n               Called to get support for Alcatel Joy Tab.

Admitted they overcharged me and instead of refunding my bill in full they\\'ve been sending me 2 dollar prepaid credit cards for the last 6 months since I left. Bills often are retroactively changed on T-Mobile account. Pretty sure they are committing some sort of fraud. Once again, I hope they go out of business soon. Service sucks too. I went to AT and T and they are better in every possible way. ** t mobile.\\n              </p>\\n             </div>\\n             <div class=\"rvw-foot\">\\n              <div class=\"rvw-foot__fdbck js-helpful-link hidden-no-js\" data-track-goal=\"profile:helpful_usr_acq_btn:click\" data-uapi-event=\\'{\"element\": \"review_helpful\", \"action\": \"yes\", \"context\": { \"review id\": \"8017855\" }}\\' data-uapi-event-name=\"helpful\">\\n               <input name=\"helpful\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"helpful\"/>\\n               <label for=\"helpful\">\\n                <svg height=\"14\" viewbox=\"0 0 15 14\" width=\"15\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\\n                 <path class=\"ca-icon__colored-fill\" d=\"M14.903 8.356c-.019-.445-.237-.794-.417-1.008.209-.474.29-1.22-.407-1.8-.51-.425-1.375-.615-2.575-.562-.843.035-1.548.178-1.577.184a12.73 12.73 0 0 0-.507.094c-.013-.187.023-.653.401-1.701.449-1.247.423-2.202-.083-2.84C9.206.053 8.356 0 8.106 0a.84.84 0 0 0-.62.258c-.355.377-.313 1.074-.269 1.396-.423 1.037-1.609 3.578-2.613 4.283-.019.012-.035.027-.05.041a3.136 3.136 0 0 0-.63.861 1.425 1.425 0 0 0-.634-.146H1.334C.596 6.693 0 7.24 0 7.91v4.757c0 .673.6 1.218 1.334 1.218H3.29c.285 0 .551-.082.77-.223l.753.082c.115.015 2.167.252 4.274.214.381.026.74.041 1.074.041.574 0 1.074-.04 1.491-.123.981-.19 1.651-.57 1.991-1.13.26-.427.26-.852.218-1.121.638-.527.75-1.11.728-1.52a1.832 1.832 0 0 0-.131-.588c.314-.366.465-.758.445-1.162z\" fill=\"#3E3D3F\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\">\\n                 </path>\\n                </svg>\\n                Helpful\\n               </label>\\n              </div>\\n              <span class=\"rvw-foot__helpful-count js-helpful-count\">\\n               <strong>\\n                21 people\\n               </strong>\\n               found this review helpful\\n              </span>\\n             </div>\\n            </div>\\n            <div class=\"rvw js-rvw\" data-id=\"8016823\" id=\"review-8016823\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\">\\n             <div class=\"rvw__hdr\">\\n              <div class=\"rvw__hdr-stat\" itemprop=\"reviewRating\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Rating\">\\n               <meta content=\"1\" itemprop=\"worstRating\"/>\\n               <img alt=\"Rated with 1 star\" class=\"stars-rtg stars-rtg--sm\" data-rating=\"1.0\" src=\"//media.consumeraffairs.com/static/img/icons/stars/ca-stars-1.86dfada66e1f.svg\"/>\\n               <meta content=\"1\" itemprop=\"ratingValue\"/>\\n               <meta content=\"5\" itemprop=\"bestRating\"/>\\n              </div>\\n             </div>\\n             <div class=\"rvw-aut\">\\n              <img alt=\"profile pic of the author\" class=\"rvw__pic lazy-load fadein\" data-src=\"https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/cache/profile-photos/photo_919241_head_shot_micro.jpg\" height=\"50\" width=\"50\"/>\\n              <div class=\"rvw-aut__inf\">\\n               <strong class=\"rvw-aut__inf-nm\" itemprop=\"author\">\\n                Robot of Los Angeles, CA\\n               </strong>\\n               <strong class=\"rvw-aut__inf-ver\">\\n                <svg height=\"7\" viewbox=\"0 0 9 7\" width=\"9\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\\n                 <path class=\"ca-icon__colored-fill\" d=\"M4.04 4.36l-1.225.114.568-.536.657.421zM7.27.271a1 1 0 0 1 1.373 1.456L4.187 5.929a1 1 0 0 1-1.226.114l-2.5-1.602A1 1 0 1 1 1.54 2.757l1.843 1.181L7.27.272z\" fill=\"#0E9C3F\" fill-rule=\"nonzero\">\\n                 </path>\\n                </svg>\\n                Verified Reviewer\\n               </strong>\\n              </div>\\n             </div>\\n             <div class=\"rvw-bd\">\\n              <span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">\\n               Original review: June 22, 2020\\n              </span>\\n              <p>\\n              </p>\\n              <p>\\n               T-mobile is such a horrible service and bad management, the guys kept babbling, arguing without making any sense or being reasonable for an hour.

I said I no longer need the service since I lost my expensive phone. I never receive a text, email or letter to tell me what they did to me. On June 22, when I came to a local store, they told me there\\'s a month charge for support, data, etc. which I never use date with T-mobile for a long time. They kept saying it\\'s valid and will charge me forever. If I do not pay, they will send it to collection to ruin my credit. Then saying they can waive half a month since I paid off 1/3 of the month.

Yesterday I called in to upgrade my phone. I was told of an offer that I agreed with...but they would not mail me the new phone, I had to go to the mall in person to complete. As we are in the midst of a global pandemic, that seemed problematic. At the mall, after waiting in line with mask, I was told that was not a valid offer and would have to move to a new contract at a much higher cost.

I have paid my account since 2009 but the account was in my deceased wife\\' name to start. There is no way you have any control over people adding things to the account or usage. Customer service was no help what so ever. After not being to consult with my dead Wife, I had no control over the account. Billed $271 for things I did not do. So, be sure when your Wife is dying to get her to sign the account to the husband or you will be faced with canceling the account and stopping the auto bank drafts. I will make sure the account is paid off in a few days and find another carrier. Not a happy customer nor will I ever recommend T- Mobile to the many of people I know.\\n              </p>\\n             </div>\\n             <div class=\"rvw-foot\">\\n              <div

      "[<div class=\"rvw-bd\"><span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">Original review: Sept. 25, 2020</span><p></p><p>I got on T-Mobile's network around 2013 I want to say. This was a jump after dealing with horrendous service from Sprint (I know they've improved since and merged with T-Mobile). Let me just say the switch was the start of something great. First off, the signal was killing it in my area. I mean, maximum 4G everywhere I went back then. Blazing fast and I never had dropped calls (again, my area). I even sat on a beach in Puerto Rico and had 4g right there on the sand. I'm not sure how well it works everywhere in the world, but it was also phenomenal in Quebec Canada.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-8340470-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-8340470\"><p>So enough of how great the signal is. The plans are also very generous. I got on the plan where it was unlimited everything for 100 flat for two lines. Hard to beat that for as many years as I had that. On top of that, they offer what is called T-Mobile Tuesdays via an app. I don't want to overhype it, but the fact that they do give out offers and freebies weekly to various vendors and websites is pretty astonishing. They don't have to people... Yet they've been doing this for years. I thought it was just going to be a short lived gimmick when I initially heard about it, nope. It makes me wonder why to continue that other than that they do like to give back in some form to its consumers even if you do not take all the offers that they provide. I've had countless offers of free coffees and sandwiches. :)</p><p>Now this is a big one for me that set T-Mobile to a new level. When covid-19 hit and I was fortunate to work from home, my internet provider went down for 5 days straight. The only thing I could rely on was my phone as a hotspot. First off, it was part of my service at no extra charge, and my internet was as fast as the fast speed I pay for that didn't work... Let that sink in for a minute. Sure my phone got a tad warm as it was providing me internet all day long for 5 days, but it never failed me. I can't thank T-Mobile enough for that because without it, I'm not sure what I would have done other than packing up and moving to a friend/family's house that had service running.</p><p>So I'll end with, with all the horrible large corporate big name companies out there that just count you as another value of revenue filling their pockets, T-Mobile makes you feel like they care a tad more so about you than the norm. At least enough to make me feel good when I need to send in that monthly payment. I can't say I feel Okay with about 90% of my other monthly bills, lol. So yeah, switch to T-Mobile if you want a nice phone package plan/rate with plenty of side perks. Recommended I suppose for Metro-ish areas but the fact that I've yet to lose signal anywhere I've been (my job sends me traveling all around US), I don't think you'll have too much issues with it.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-8340470\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-8340470\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-8340470-btn\">\n",

Some days passed and I noticed the sun on my phone and it led me to gently rub my finger on the screen and I felt a superficial scratch. I thought that it was just a reflection but I could feel it but not see it. I called T-Mobile to find out what to do. I was initially advised to contact Samsung to get a replacement since it was a brand new $1000 phone! </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-7931807-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-7931807\"><p>Samsung could not have cared less! They first told me to go to some repair place (UbreakIfix). They told me they would not be able to get me in for about 2 weeks. I called Samsung back to share information. I was told the best they could do is for me to mail in my phone and I would get it back in 2-4 weeks. What is that?? That is your best?? I called T-Mobile back for advice and spoke to a lovely person named Carmela out of St Louis office. She and her supervisor helped me very graciously and I will be receiving a new phone by mail with return slip to return my defective phone.

I'm also able to know what is happening in other continents.. I also appreciate because of the prices are not too high for me even though we consumers we don't lack complains but all I can say about prices is that the services are worth those prices. Generally these providers does very good task because they are making my life simple in that, I don't have to send mails when I need to communicate with someone who is a bit far from me, the cell phone providers have enabled fast services which are very important and also the cell phones themselves are portable and reliable.

To just only having to pay for the services and activation fee and yeah cannot forget their cool accessories that you can also buy upfront as well by paying in full or paying the taxes in store and paying small monthly payments also for 24 months. Just shows that Tmobile is a reasonable carrier to be with at the moment. I'm not sure how it's going to turn out, when Sprint merges with tmobile as the prices will change and perhaps increase indefinitely. If that does happen, I will no longer be part of Tmobile and probably would have to improvise on another reasonable carrier or better yet go to Boost Mobile that I have never even been with since they came out. But after this COVID-19 pandemic we shall see.</p></div>, <div class=\"rvw-bd\"><span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">Original review: Feb. 19, 2020</span><p></p><p>I like Tmobile because it has affordable services to call abroad, also when I am in Mexico I can call and browse as if I were in the US. The basic service with unlimited phone and good GB per month is about 45 plus 10 dollars for the international fee. I don’t like that their customer service sucks. Every time I call I have to wait a lot to talk to a human and I am never sure if I ever speak to one.

I switched because It was promised that the network was better and faster with new nationwide 5G and that T-Mobile would pay off the balance remaining from my current device on Verizon. I was told to bring in my final bill and I would get a Visa card to pay it off. I went in with the final bill and learned that I was misinformed and not eligible for the promotion. So I had to pay off my device from Verizon. I spent hours trying to fight this and still there is no resolution. Then there is the network. I am still not able to use apps I enjoy like TikTok unless I’m on wifi. The network is too slow to stream videos. Often it is too slow to even load photos on social media like Instagram. I called many times and there is no resolution.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-8683193-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-8683193\"><p>I often hear the excuse that Covid is the cause of this. Because there are more people at home during the day. I don’t buy that. If you’re using your phone at home, you’re most likely using wifi and not T-Mobile’s network. There is also issues with call quality and sending text messages. People tell me often that when they call my phone does not ring. It goes to voicemail. There is also no resolution to this. I have made many calls and visits to try and resolve these issues. You can also expect long wait times to speak to anyone. Last night it was 2 hours. But that’s because of Covid too. I decided to give T-Mobile another chance and I bought the new iPhone 12 Max Pro, in hopes that the 5g would help with these issues.</p><p>I was told that I would get 550 off the cost of the new phone as a promotion for trading in my device. There was also going to be a 380 immediate credit to my account that I could use as I wanted. Again, I was misinformed. The real deal is 550 off in bill credits but over 30 months. The 380 is taken from the 550 and this there is only 170 off the total price of the phone. This is a lot different than what was explained to me. I have spent hours trying to get them to honor what was promised. But again, I am left paying a lot more than expected for service on a shoddy poor network.</p><p>The 5g is actually very strong in my area, but it is not any faster unless you use it late at night. All in all, T-Mobile has been a huge disappointment. I am actually going to pay cash for my new device and switch to AT&amp;T. They actually offer a generous discount for doctors and nurses (in addition to teachers, active military, veterans, and first responders!). I would strongly suggest that you do your research before switching to this company. If you google reviews for T-Mobile (wish I had done this) you will be hard pressed to find any independent sites with a 2 star or higher rating for T-Mobile with multiple comments similar to mine.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-8683193\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-8683193\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-8683193-btn\">\n",

First, I was T-Mobile customer years ago and I was very much impressed by their customer service. I moved to a new location that had a worthless T-Mobile signal, so I had to switch to AT&amp;T. Years later, I rejoined T-Mobile. Despite their promises that they had a good signal, it turned out T-Mobile had a very inadequate signal at my new address. After 7 months of waiting for T-Mobile to provide the promised signal booster, they told me to find another carrier. They were unwilling to compensate me for 7 months of crappy coverage.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-8681459-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-8681459\"><p>When I left T-Mobile, my ex-wife spun off her own account, which was supposed to include her phone on her line on which she was making payments. That same afternoon, I went online to pay off my balance. T-Mobile had left her phone on my account. I called immediately, and they agreed they'd made a mistake. After 30 days of them not being able to actually make this phone go to the ex's account because their computer system has/had a glitch, they offered to just give me a credit to zero out my account.</p><p>The next month, instead of a credit, T-Mobile doubled the charge. After many, many, many calls and countless hours of my wasted time, as well as a letter to the department which handles disputes, I was sent to collections. Sadly, the company I had switched to was Sprint because their coverage map showed great coverage where I live (BTW: the area where I live has no access to broadband, so my phone is my only access to the world), but what their coverage map showed wasn't true.</p><p>A few months later (right after Sprint and TM merged), the closest tower to my house went offline due to a part that is indefinitely backordered with absolutely any idea by Sprint/T-Mobile when that tower will work again. No compensation for this either. I went to Verizon. When I tried to pay off my Sprint leased phone and close my account, T-Mobile did everything within their power to keep my account open so they could continue charging me. You cannot cancel your account in the app or online. You MUST call and wait and wait and wait to talk to someone who will tell you that you have to call another dept, and start the whole process over.</p><p>That would be bad enough, but even after you find the right dept and tell them to close your account, they refuse. You must provide irrefutable justification as to why, and they deemed my experience with them as not enough - so they just kept putting me on hold, transferring me around, and asking me over and over what they could do to keep me from leaving. Did NOT matter to them that my number was already ported to VZW weeks earlier. I spent hours on the phone, chat, and in the store before they would close my account and agree to stop charging me for service I was not getting or using.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-8681459\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-8681459\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-8681459-btn\">\n",

They sent my new phone through the mail, I received it and I sent the old phone into their warehouse. I received an email saying they did not have my phone so I started dealing with customer service and got the runaround for a month telling me that they could not find the phone I sent in. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-8440928-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-8440928\"><p>Then after dealing with them for a month I called the corporate office in Bellevue Washington and spoke to a man named Gabe. I told him everything that had been going on and that the only thing I wanted to do was to take the new phone in and close my account after being told by one of their experts that I had sent in an empty box. Well I was not on the phone with him more than 5 minutes and guess what. They found the phone. I was still not happy since I had been told I had sent in an empty box. So I told him again that all I wanted to do was take the phone back into them and close my account and he started in on that I had been with them for so long and that I should not let 1 little incident take me away from the company and I told him I was still not happy and he said that he would give me a $50.00 credit to my account. </p><p>They can keep the $50.00, he may call it one little incident but being told that I had sent in an empty box and pretty much told I was lying about sending it in. Now mind you he never called me a liar but he sure pointed to it several times. So a small piece of advice don't use T-Mobile or Sprint unless you want to be screwed over and over. It took 11 calls and me giving them the tracking information 11 times before their ever found the phone and then they only found it after I called corporate so something does not sound right. You may pay a little more with another company but it will be worth not being told that things being said is only 1 little incident and thinking $50.00 dollars is going to fix everything, guess what. It hasn't. </p><p>I am going on every website that I can find and leave a review about how I was treated by their team of experts and then how corporate treated me. I will also be filing a repost with the Washington State AG office on Monday morning. So just a little piece of advice unless you like being treated badly I would go elsewhere to look for a phone and stay completely away from T Mobile and Sprint. They are both owned by the same company.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-8440928\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-8440928\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-8440928-btn\">\n",

I reviewed this phone for weeks before purchasing. I get it and start having specific issues with connection, dropping calls, search issues etc. only to find out that I was looking in the wrong place for my reviews. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE. There is a software issue with this phone that Samsung IS aware of and has not put out an update to fix it. You will call in and someone will tell you to factory reset your phone, they will say they have not heard of any issues. Let me tell you, if you look it up under connection issues you will see all types of review. All the major carriers push this phone knowing it has issues which is wrong...Shame on you! And shame on samsung for not fixing the issues. I've always loved the Galaxy phones, cheaped out on this model to save a few bucks, sure wish I had not.

After a week of waiting for an update I was told, when I called them, that they had done nothing. I'm basically paying $1,200 for a paperweight and they will not remedy it other than send me refurbished phones that do not work either.

They just said you sign it. And Like a said I learn my lesson because for trusting this company. They put me an to a deal that I didn't want. They offered me 2 phones that supposedly there were half of and they end up charging me full price because the agent that help me put me an a different deal, different than what he told me that's why don't trust this company.

When they did if I moved more than a foot from the spot I was it would drop the call. Another call to customer service and $25 deposit later I had to install a signal router extender and now I finally have service in my house but leave the house and you go in and out of service a dozen times before getting to the retail location 1 1/2 miles from my house. </p><p>Then the 2nd bill comes in and it's nothing like what I expected, $12 more a month then the agreement I signed. I called and got a CSR on the phone and explained what I had and wanted to know why my bill was that far off of what I expected and then he tells me \"the promotion was buy 1 get 1 but anything over $1,000 you have to pay the difference\". NOWHERE in the agreement or any of the conversations I had stated that but he stuck to his guns and told me, \"If you ever have a question on a promo or anything, call us.\" I cut him off and told him again, that this was in NONE of the paperwork I have and I read every word. Then he starts to tell me \"you really need to go through these agreements and promotions, I've missed things before and you probably just missed it\".</p><p>I MISSED nothing but I am kicking myself for ever making the change to T-Mobile and will be going back to Verizon at the first chance I get but I hope that this review will help others make their decisions but know full well the T-Mobile sales tactics are very deceptive and it's concerning since they are now one of the largest carrier out there with their acquisition of Sprint.

I ended up paying an extra almost $200, because they ended up putting me on an account on my own, my sister's account with her number was never cancelled, and my grandma was on an account by herself. Around August, I talked to another person (after trying to sort things out in June and July but never could) and it turned out that I was paying for both accounts and a total of four lines when I only had two active lines. They said that they would reimburse me for the extra money I ended up paying due to all the confusion. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-8330261-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-8330261\"><p>I was supposed to receive that money around 2 weeks ago. I called customer service, and they said that I couldn't access that money because my account was closed (seeing as how I moved over to AT&amp;T after this disaster). This, however, made little to no sense to me seeing as how on the bill that I received, it said that it was going to be transferred to my bank account. After being placed on hold for about an hour (in total since May, probably would add up to around 7 hours on hold), I was in contact with someone that said in their \"expert\" opinion that everything was sorted out and that I should get my money back in 72 hours. I asked the representative (Kenneth) what if on the off chance I don't get my money, how should I proceed? He said not to worry because he was an \"expert,\" but I was asking for next steps in case I had to call back and go through several hours of waiting again. Instead of giving me an answer, the dude chose to hang up on me. </p><p>I try not to get frustrated, but I have been dealing with this since May and it is now September. I like to think that a company that self-proclaims to have the best customer service and the happiest customers to be a littler more considerate, especially since I have had to sort this out for SEVERAL months. Even when I tried to go in a physical store to sort this out, they said that these kind of account changes can only happen via on the phone using T-Mobile's customer service. It is safe to say that I am incredibly unhappy with this outcome and that moving over to AT&amp;T is one of the best decisions I have made since I was born. Anyone who actually reads this, do yourself a favor and just not even consider T-Mobile. Yeah the phone bills don't seem like a lot, but they like to hide a bunch of fees (even when you say you don't want it) and their customer service representatives will think it's cute to hang up on you mid-sentence.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-8330261\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-8330261\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-8330261-btn\">\n",

I could not even make a complete call without dropping. Then they said l would be cut off as of Sept 10. That is the day l was crossing the border into Canada. The company gave me a choice, l could voluntarily suspend my phone which would allow me to retain my phone number or l could wait for them to cut it off and lose my phone number. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-8325551-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-8325551\"><p>I did the voluntary suspension because l wanted to retain my number. When l went with TMobile, they were not able to port my phone number, which was from Alaska, (l had that number to close to 25 years) to their system. I had to get a new number which upended my life. I did not want to go through another phone number change. So, the voluntary suspension worked better for me. There l was, Sept 10 in Canada, nowhere next to nothing, without a phone in case of emergency. A week before l left Alaska, the company rep told me to write a letter to their Executive Customers Relations unit. They could give me a 5 day extension. I either had to mail the letter or fax it. Mail would be a 10 day response time, fax would be a 5 day response. I faxed the letter. I was never given the courtesy of a response.  </p><p>Needless to say, the moment l drove across the border into WA l found the nearest Verizon company office and  had my phone number ported to the new account. For denying a 5 day extension, TMobile lost years of business from me. This is a company that will step on you for 1 more dollar in their pocket. They did not care about my safety in an extreme rural area and showed no flexibility.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-8325551\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-8325551\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-8325551-btn\">\n",

We were not happy with the cheap almost obsolete phones that didn't cost us a thing and the reception. (I live less than 1/2 mile from the T-Mobile store.) What they told me my rates would be certainly beat the other company, plus they talked me into buying a 5g phone that was on special for 2 for 1. My sister really couldn't handle a phone like that but they almost insisted that I take them up on that offer. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-8265791-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-8265791\"><p>Now my second bill is $20 to $30 more than I was told it would be. I called and said I wanted to pay off the charge for the 2 phones in order to lower my bill. They said I had to pay the balance for 2 phones rather than the 2 for 1 price because I had signed up for a promotion that wouldn't end for several years! Very disappointed in their billing support department mostly because they couldn't understand me at all, even when I was transferred to a supervisor who had very broken English. There was also no way to lower my bill so here I sit with the bill going up and up every month. </p><p>Oh, and the super duper phones are doing exactly what the cheap no charge phones were doing. I've called their Tech Support twice and they said there are bad signals coming thru but the only solution is to use 4g connection rather than wifi. So I bought 5g phones but there's no 5g coverage in our area and I have to resort to the wifi to send anything in a text because T-Mobile's 5g that's really a 4g doesn't work.

We were one of their most unusual cases because we have 2 accounts with 3 lines on each account, and of those 6 phone lines, we had 5 excellent working Note 4s until Friday, July 10th when we woke up with NO SERVICE!! I spent several hours with their top tech (EXPERT), and he was bewildered, and he had no clue what was going on. The next day, Saturday, another t-mobile (EXPERT) tried.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-8146943-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-8146943\"><p>It was obvious that T-Mobile did something with their network. One t-mobile (EXPERT TECH) swore up and down it was the phone, and the other t-mobile (EXPERT) said he was certain it was the t-mobile network. When I asked for compensation, it was a BIG TO DO!! I was bounced around from representative to represent from TEAM to TEAM all over the country, and finally settled with a calm, but very slick (PERFECT T-MOBILE SOLDIER)!! She was very tricky, dicky, sneaky, and dishonest!! We are getting compensation with different phones, but this (PERFECT T-MOBILE SOLDIER) tricked us into getting lesser compensation. There's much more to the story, and maybe later I will finish it, but I will say without a doubt, T-MOBILE is a HORRIBLE COMPANY, and PLEASE STAY AWAY From them!!!</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-8146943\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-8146943\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-8146943-btn\">\n",

And if you don't carefully watch what's going on, you will miss and they will keep on stealing from the millions of clients they have. This month it was $30, next month could be $3 but it still a theft. This month I was charged $138 instead of the $109 I am supposed to pay. I immediately noticed and called to see what's going on and I was informed that they did some changes on my account (unauthorized of course, and without my knowledge) and this is why my bill was $30 extra.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-8146805-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-8146805\"><p>They apologized and issued a credit,. This is the second time I caught them cheating by making up false charges and they always apologize and refund them. But the only reason I noticed was because both times was amounts over $20.

I would receive text messages hours after they had been sent. Internet was constantly being throttled to lower speeds. So, I decided to port my number to mint mobile and not continue my service with tmobile. I contacted tmobile and asked what I needed to do to port my number. I was told that my account was in good standing, service would end on July 5th &amp; I was given my account number &amp; pin. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-8080376-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-8080376\"><p>Today July 9th I attempted to port my phone number to Mint and it wouldn't go through. So, I called tmobile and the rep said that they can't port a number from a deactivated phone (this is a lie) &amp; I would have to pay $75 plus a reactivation fee. I refused &amp; after her speaking with her manager she agreed to turn my service back on for free so I could port the number. I call back Mint, the number still won't port. I call tmobile, the new rep tells me that I cannot port a number until I pay the current balance of $77 for the cycle beginning July 5th. I explain that it is impossible for me to have a remaining balance because I pay month to month &amp; my service ended on July 5th in good standing. </p><p>After a long hold he gets back on &amp; says the past due amount is actually from January. I explain again, that I pay month to month, at no time has tmobile said that I had a past due balance &amp; I was specifically told that my account was in good standing. Another long hold, he comes back &amp; says the charge is actually from February. I disagree. His manager comes on &amp; explains the charge is actually due July 24th. I again explain that I don't want service, I have always paid upfront for service on a month to month basis meaning that a payment due on July 24th would provide me with service into August. He puts me on hold. At this point I begin to question why I have been given 5 reasons for this mysterious charge. Manager gets back on &amp; says \"oh, I see now, the charge is actually from May\".

Customer service was no help what so ever. After not being to consult with my dead Wife, I had no control over the account. Billed $271 for things I did not do. So, be sure when your Wife is dying to get her to sign the account to the husband or you will be faced with canceling the account and stopping the auto bank drafts.

T-mobile said I needed a new phone so I bought a new phone but the problems persisted. They sent me a third phone and still the same problems. Note this has been going on for 16 months. I finally asked to leave them since they cannot resolve their service problems and I was told I cannot return the phone they sent me just 4 days ago and they want me to pay for the remainder of the phone; which I did not need in the first place, or I can return the phone and I have to lose the $453 I paid on the phone. They will not release my phone number unless I pay more. I've been paying for the worst service and they are not even ashamed for their poor service.</p></div>, <div class=\"rvw-bd\"><span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">Original review: May 31, 2020</span><p></p><p>Most of time calls doesn't go through and go direct to my voice mail.

I purchased a phone from Best Buy, that also have a gripe with being that they sold me an \"UNLOCKED PHONE\" that was not. Not only Ting mobile contacting and failing to get T-Mobile to unlock my phone to use another carrier, I also could not get T-Mobile to unlock my very expensive I-Phone. So therefore T-Mobile burned a bridge with me. I am switching carriers and never looking back at T-Mobile or Best Buy ever again. I do not recommend buying a phone from Best Buy or using T-Mobile.

As I looked around, I found Verizon had a better deal, so I called T-Mobile and gave them the opportunity to match the Verizon deal. They would not, so I requested the return information, and sent the phones back to T-Mobile using their label. I ended service with T-Mobile and switched to Verizon. In March I began receiving emails that I owed $1513.99. I have called them at least 7 times. During the first 5 calls I was told the box was on the dock (it apparently sat there for 3 months). The only reason I got that far is because I kept the shipping receipt. During the next 2 calls they told me the phones were missing. They have the IMEI number. They can locate the phones is they are turned on. They can shut down the phones if they are turned on.

I went to upgrade one of my iPhone 8 to (11 Pro - it cost $999.99). This transaction occurred at 4143 Baldwin, Auburn Hills, MI 48326. Somehow wife does not like the phone because it has too much yellow color when taking photo and even you look at someone else photos in Facebook and many other webs. I was gonna exchanged it to a S20 Samsung and the lady said the stocking fee will be $50. So that made me felt like getting ripped off. I end up stopped buying the S20. I don't know what T-Mobile is thinking about their stocking fee, to me that is too much, I can see 15-20 dollars but not $50. For now on I will not buy any phone from T-Mobile due to their stocking fee. I will buy them directly from either Samsung or Apple.</p></div>, <div class=\"rvw-bd\"><span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">Original review: May 22, 2020</span><p></p><p>The Tmobile store on 1498 Union Ave. Memphis TN 38104 has the worst customer service I have experienced in years. Went into the store last week to purchase the new Iphone and the salesman wondered out of the back room 5 minutes after I started shopping only to snap at me that they were not going to open for another 5 minutes. So being that I did NOT appreciate his attitude I went home and ordered the phone through Amazon. A few days later I go back to the same store to activate my new Iphone, only to be greeted by a Tmobile lady sitting in the front of the store arrogantly barking at me that I need to wear a mask. I stated that I chose not to wear one and her partner jumped up also arrogantly saying then you can't come in the store. This is shameful customer service and it seems like all the employees at this store have a remarkably horrible attitude. I will never return to this store again.</p></div>, <div class=\"rvw-bd\"><span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">Original review: May 21, 2020</span><p></p><p>In November of 2019, my wife and I were in the market for new phones. A T-Mobile Sales Rep offered us two free phones, if we switched service plans. We told him we were paying Boost $110 per month for three lines, but were planning to drop our son from the account in a couple of months. After doing some research, he said he could beat that price at $105 per month. The only thing we had to do to secure that discounted amount is sign-up for automatic payment. So, we purchased the phone service in November, and then signed up for automatic payment in early December, as well as dropped our son from the plan. This dropped our bill to $84 for the month of December. Great! Everything was going as expected. However, in January, we no longer received the discounted pricing, raising our monthly cost to $98 for two lines. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-7927580-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-7927580\"><p>In addition, in late January, for some unexplained reason, we were dropped from auto-pay. So, our February bill jumped to $108. We re-established the auto-pay and the bill, subsequently, returned to $98 per month. I spoke with CS Rep., Mark, at length on April 22nd in an effort to reset my bill to an amount in alignment with what the Sales Rep sold us - approximately $84 per month for 2 lines. I spoke with the CSR at length. He spoke with his supervisor that gave him approval to make all of the necessary adjustments. He said everything will be adjusted 1 week following the May bill of $98. Well, 10 days prior to the May bill due date, I called T-Mobile just to make sure we're all on the same page. Well... CSR Mark never documented anything from our conversation and when questioned by another CSR, he denied everything. </p><p>To make a long story shorter, I spoke with multiple reps over the next three days, including Supervisor Jose and Manager Matthew - all from the El Paso. TX Customer Service Center. I discovered that the service plan I was placed on cost $108 for 2 lines, minus the auto-pay discount of $10, bringing us to $98 per month (taxes and fees included). </p><p>The $105 for 3 lines was a special only good for one month - which is exactly what happened to us - we were just never told. We were made to believe it was their standard rates. So, the Supervisor Jose informed me there was no other option for us, except to pay more for a different plan and if we decided to go to another service provider, we would have to pay the remaining cost of both phones. Wait a minute! What remaining cost? I thought they were free for switching service providers. Wrong again! I found out there is an $8.34 charge for each phone per month that they credit us for... unless we choose to leave T-Mobile. If then, we would have to pay the remaining balance of the phones - ultimately several hundred dollars. </p><p>Supervisor Jose was kind enough to say he will follow-up with complaints to the supervisors for CSR Mark for lying and to the Store Manager of the Sales Rep. I have no way of confirming that actually happened. I continued to escalate my issue to Manager Matthew. His attitude was very careless and left me with the mindset that anything that can be done has been - which was absolutely nothing at all. I called back the next day and asked to speak to whomever Manager Matthew reports to. </p><p>About an hour later, Matthew called again and he seemed a little upset that I was calling again and attempting to go over his head. I told him that in my world, when a company's representatives make grave errors, the company takes the hit for those errors - not the customer. In this case, it's the opposite. I, also, told him I was unwilling to accept that there was nothing T-Mobile can do about two of their reps lying to their customer. So, instead of offering solutions, he began questioning me, in a not-so-nice manner: \"Well, what do you want? What is it going to take? Give me an amount?\" - as if I was wasting his time. So, I told him that though T-Mobile does not have a suitable plan in the price range I sold on, T-Mobile could make an adjustment that accounts for what the Sales Rep sold us. </p><p>I find it sad that after all the people I spoke to over the previous three days, let alone the 10 other times I called before than - the customer had to come up with a reasonable solution to satisfy the customer. Manager Matthew agreed to the solution and hung up the phone. He never once apologized for the behavior of the T-Mobile Sales Rep or CS Rep. I believe the El Paso, TX Customer Service Center is flawed in their approach due to bad leadership.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-7927580\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-7927580\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-7927580-btn\">\n",

I will admit, they were very affordable and service wasn't GREAT, but it was good enough without too many issues aside from it being slow or having a hard time finding service at times. To me, this wasn't a huge issue given the affordability. Customer service is also very polite. The few times I needed to speak to them about anything, which was rare, the wait wasn't long and the agent was always very friendly.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-7871267-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-7871267\"><p>The problem I have is that though they were friendly, they seemed to have been making false promises in a friendly tone. Specifically, when it came to unlocking my wife and I's iPhone X's so we could port over to Verizon. I called on Monday, 5/4/20, in the evening after starting the porting process with Verizon after receiving my new SIM cards in the mail. When I put my new SIM card in, it said that the phone was locked by the carrier (T-Mobile) and to contact them to get it unlocked. Fortunately, since I am working from home at the moment I had my work phone online to make the customer service call. I was told by the rep that she had started the unlock process and it would take 48-72 hours, which is frustrating, but per my searches online, was pretty normal. Again, she was very polite about it.</p><p>I spent all of Tuesday checking my email constantly to see if I had received the email yet, nothing, so Wednesday morning, I made a call to T-Mobile customer service again to follow up. This time, I was told that it had not been accepted yet, but she would \"escalate\" it and I should have an answer within the next couple of hours. This was at 10am ish. </p><p>Fast forward to today, Thursday, 5/7/20. I just got off the phone with them, again, around 10am. This time when I called in, it didn't give me an immediate option to speak with a representative, it just kept looping the options to reactivate, check my balance, change my address, or repeat options. After some patience, I finally got to speak with a rep. This time I was told that my unlock request was denied because of my remaining balance. </p><p>To provide context, both of our phones have been paid off from them for about a year now (maybe a little less), and I have literally never missed a payment due to auto pay and always having the money needed in the account for them. Not once did I miss a payment. Auto pay typically comes out on the 13th-15th, so it had not paid this month. I want to add that the payment was not past due, just up to be paid in the upcoming week as normally scheduled.</p><p>I went ahead and paid the balance and the rep told me the request should go through without a problem this time. I expressed to her that the 72 hour mark previously mentioned will hit this evening and my wife and I have been without phones since Monday and asked if there was any way this can be expedited due to that. She told me that she would \"escalate\" it, but to be honest, she didn't think it would make much of a difference due to the process of them sending a request. I will note that I appreciate her honesty with this instead of blowing smoke with a friendly tone as the previous reps had done.</p><p>This, however, is still extremely frustrating as that 72 hour process starts all over again. Due to working from home, as mentioned before, I am required to do a multi-factor authentication that involves me getting a text message from my company to verify who I am, but I have been unable to get that text and verify myself due to not having cell service. This will have me for a week unable to work.</p><p>I am at fault for not knowing about the carrier lock that was placed on our phones, that I admit, though, I disagree with a lock being required once the phone has been paid off. The main frustrating that I have from this experience, aside from the phone being locked at all, is that had the first rep told me that I needed to pay off the balance in order for this process to work, I would have paid it right then and there and I would hopefully have a cell phone again. This experience has been unacceptable.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-7871267\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-7871267\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-7871267-btn\">\n",

IT IS NOT UNLIMITED. T-Mobile cuts off your data and internet if you have used a certain amount of data before your 30 days are up for the month. I recently found on my cell phone that I couldn't search the internet or do anything except make phone calls. My monthly account was not set to expire for 5 days, but T-Mobile claimed I had used up all my data for the month despite their spurious Unlimited Data advertising.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-7767665-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-7767665\"><p>I proceeded to pay T-Mobile with my debit Mastercard over the phone with their automated system. I naively assumed that PAYING T-MOBILE MONEY would renew my account, only to discover that I still couldn't access the internet. I called T-Mobile Customer Service which routes to a foreign country where the workers DO NOT speak English as their native language. I am in America and DO speak English as my native language, thereby making fluid conversations a bit difficult with people in foreign countries, but I told 10 T-Mobile workers in 10 phone calls that T-Mobile cannot keep my money without restoring my account immediately. I was repeatedly told that my account won't be restored for 5 more days. I asked for T-Mobile to refund my money, only to be told that a refund would take 7 to 10 days. I hung up the phone for the 10th time after saying that I would report T-Mobile to the FBI.</p><p>I naively called the FBI, and they refused to investigate T-Mobile. I argued that it isn't just me that T-Mobile is deceiving by keeping my money and not restoring my account, but it's a cumulative practice affecting many T-Mobile customers. The FBI still refused. Although my T-Mobile account is now restored, the company should NOT ACCEPT CUSTOMERS' MONEY unless the customers' dormant accounts are instantly credited and restored when customer payments are received and processed by T-Mobile</p><p>Also troubling is that the automated T-Mobile recording always asks, \"Do you want to refill your account now?\" The company automation system would gladly accept as many payments as I could make with no record that I just made a payment. The automated voice also requires that customers provide their account PIN number, but that is a useless exercise because the T-Mobile foreign call center worker also requires a customer PIN number. Why must we provide our PIN number twice? Once should be sufficient. I think BIG BUSINESS basically only cares about money, and we gullible suckers must adhere to corporate malpractice to simply take part in modern society.

It shows up as multiples due to dollar amounts are different. I have sent letters to everyone TMobile, FCC, Credit Bureaus, ConsumerAffairs, Public Utilities. Basically they sell phones then they put up towers.</p></div>, <div class=\"rvw-bd\"><span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">Original review: March 30, 2020</span><p></p><p>Horrible connectivity, more dead spots than live ones even in a small city with numerous towers.

But last year they cut off the phone on Christmas Eve (which was actually 3 days earlier than normal). They must be doing it by design to rack up all the $20 re-instatement fees. My family alone is $60 EVERYTIME they do it. Here's the scenario. Our bill hits on the 17th. Normally, well for 21 years at least, I pay the bill with my last check of the month. I go into the store, because they have a problem processing my debit card over the phone, just them mind you... I have been a customer since 1999.

I had the itch to depart from Verizon and its massive bill I paid monthly to them for a single line of service. Like many, money is tight and I wanted to make a change. I did my research and decided to pick TMobile because the coverage has massively improved over the years. Things seemed to be in a positive light for me. I called and spoke to a rep who explained the process and how easy it would be to port my number and get the credit to pay off Verizon and cut the ties for good. They were wrong.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-7731410-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-7731410\"><p>I was told I would receive credits for device reimbursement in two ways. Sending in my device (Samsung note 9) would grant one half of the credit via a MasterCard for what the phone is worth ~ 170$. The next credit I would receive the same way via MasterCard for the rest of what I owed on my Verizon device. All that was left was a final monthly payment for my service to Verizon. This was incorrect.</p><p>TMobile gives you 30 days to submit that final bill for the second credit. I was told to go into a Verizon store and request a final bill statement. After trying to achieve this as I was told, it was not possible. Verizon takes a lengthy amount of time processing this final bill which will be mailed to you to the address on hand. I left with no bill and the only thing I got was anxiety I would be stuck paying off what I thought would be taken care of.</p><p>Thankfully, I got my final bill around the 25 day mark. I went to the website explained to me after much confusion. I was met with several processing errors for reimbursement. So I called TMobile once again and after a couple of hours on the phone I got to someone who manually did it for me. I was unhappy with the information I was given.</p><p>I was told I was wrong about switching and how carrier freedom works. News to me... She processed my credit for the second part of the reimbursement and granted me around 50$ less than the original price I was told, I was then told that my credit for trading in my device would be applied to my TMobile bill after 2-3 billing cycles. What the hell? This was definitely not what I was told.</p><p>Not a great start to my new carrier, now I'm stuck paying off my phone to Verizon anyway minus around 200$~ and waiting months to receive anything else. At this rate I wish I stayed with Verizon paid my phone off and paid 20$ extra than my TMobile bill. Now I'm left with regret and so much to pay for something I thought would be easy. I feel scammed a little for getting credit on your bills in 2 months vs actually being able to pay my phone off to Verizon which is owed now.</p>\n",

I needed it to provide temporary home Internet service while my home was being repaired (my DSL service was temporarily unavailable). I purchased the HotSpot device and 3 months of service. Now I have moved and have a similar situation.  T-Mobile is not competitive regarding data-only service using a HotSpot. I determined the HotSpot I purchased was compatible with another operator's network and hence requested T-Mobile to unlock my device. My situation completely satisfies all requirements T-Mobile has for allowing a free Unlock. I called T-Mobile Customer Service and opened a case. The representative told me I would receive a phone call with the unlock code in 3 days. On the 3rd day I received a call and was told they needed 2 more days. I was promised an eMail with the unlock code and a phone call from Customer Service in 2 days.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-7709177-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-7709177\"><p>After 2 days expired I did not receive a call. On the 3rd day I called T-Mobile Customer Service. Over 90 minutes I was transferred from person to person with the excuse that nobody could find my account. I had never been given a \"Case Number\" and therefore I was finally told nothing had been done and I had to start over.  The last representative magically found my account, opened a case, and gave me the case number. He said it would take 72 hours, at which time I would receive an eMail with the unlock code and a phone call.</p><p>After 72 hours I did not receive a call or an eMail. So I called Customer Service. Again I was transferred from person to person for 90 minutes. All of them refused to allow me to tell them the case number. They told me they did not need the case number but could not explain why they could not find my account or case in their system. Finally I was handed off to a very aggressive representative who explained very sternly why this was all my fault. I had not given them the information they required (which was utterly untrue - I had given them ALL of the information requested) and that they were not in the business of providing unlock codes. She then proceeded to tell me that it takes a minimum of 32 days to get an unlock code! This after they burned 2 weeks of my time.</p><p>I worked (as a vendor) at the T-Mobile USA headquarters in Bellevue WA for several years. (I no longer have that job nor do business with T-Mobile.) I know the people who handle unlock codes. If you have the IMEI it takes about 15 seconds to get an unlock code. So Customer Service is punishing me for taking my equipment to a different operator. The law is very clear - if you meet the requirements to get an unlock code the operator MUST provide it to you. My account and device are very clearly within the rules. I know many people who have had similar experiences with T-Mobile for different situations. T-Mobile by far has the worst Customer Service of any operator doing business in the USA. Do not get service from them under any circumstances. Not only is Customer Service poor but their coverage is miserable.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-7709177\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-7709177\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-7709177-btn\">\n",

However, given my experience up to this point, I’m not confident that they will. I strongly advise against going with T-Mobile, there are far superior providers with better deals. And if you do go with T-Mobile, be prepared to deactivate your account on the last day of the billing cycle unless you want to pay for days of service that was not used or active.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-7625834\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-7625834\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-7625834-btn\">\n",

I thought the minutes ran out too fast. I loved the different style of phones to choose from. However, in the end I decided to get on my daughter's cell phone plan. It cost more money than a prepaid, but, I vent it was worth it. I didn't have to worry about using up my minutes while having a conversation.

Saturday was my birthday and my wife for months has been talking about new phones. We went to T Mobile to switch carriers and upgrade our phones. I told my wife of meeting a young lady who was working at the Harden Street Columbia SC store and wanted to go there to look her up and check T Mobile out. Our experience was excellent and received great service and decided to switch. We updated out phones, ordered them, and bought some accessories. We were told the phones would be delivered Tuesday or Wednesday. All was well. Then the problems began. Received email that order was shipped. Tried to check it but was unable to get to the link in the email to track. Tuesday one phone delivered. Didn't know if one was not delivered and the other stolen so I called Customer service. 800 number first kicked me off the two times I called. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-7618823-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-7618823\"><p>The CSR named \"Hannah\" who seemed from an overseas call center said she would investigate and call me back either in 30 minutes to an hour. NO CALL. I tried the 800 number again and was kicked out of the system with a busy signal given after I made my selection. I called the store I dealt with and one of the associates I had met tried to help but gave me the option to be transferred to their CARE group. I told her that would be fine. </p><p>The CSR this time tried to help but kept giving me bad information. First that the phone were processed on different dates, then she found something and saw where they were processed at the same time but one was still not shipped. I asked for information and she said it should ship either later that day or the next. I should get the phone by Saturday the 15th at the latest. I asked about the tracking of the status email and she said I needed to register with \"My TMobile\". Then she said that the phone didn't ship due to their promotion of buy one get one and the second was the promotion phone. I waited the rest of the day and until noon the next day to see if I would get another email stating that the phone had shipped. Nothing. </p><p>I packed up my stuff and headed for the store. Then things really went wrong. The store associates were again great, but the CARE folks were not. I was then told that the phone was backordered, and they could not tell me when it would be sent. I told the store associates that I wanted to cut my losses. I would just cancel my order, and would just take my refunds. I was told that I couldn't do anything until the other phone was received. Meanwhile, I'm out $300, waiting on a phone that cant be told when I'll get it, paying both my old carrier charges, and TMobile service. </p><p>I want to say, the store associates have been great but the CSR's even when asked for their names were non responsive to the customer. I was offered $20 of credit for all my trouble. I asked for a District or Regional Manager to call me. I looked up the corporate number 1-425-***-400x to call and no answer for 3 minutes I was on the phone. I wanted to voice my frustration to someone who would be able to help customers like me affect some change. I hope that this post will prompt some sort of contact with a concerned executive that honestly believes in there motto of Caring about customers.

I recently upgraded to the newer Samsung S10e. The phone constantly heats up to the degree of being too hot to hold in my hands. The screen blacks out, freezes up and while texting the system just produces verbiage on it's own. I own a business and this doesn't work for me. I exchanged for another phone..same phone and the problem is much worse. I was advised that I could not \"jump\" to any other brand until I paid half off of the defective Samsung. In the meantime, I don't know if this phone will overheat and blow up in my hands and it is frustrating to boot. If anyone else is having this issue, please let T-mobile know. My resolve is to fulfill my obligation, pay the phone off and leave T-mobile as a customer.

She then told me they can not cancel it as it’s already in processed for shipping. I was told they are going to send me a return label via email so I can put it over on the original package label then take it to UPS drop off location. She also said I will not be able to get a refund of the tax I paid for it till they get the iPhone XR and get it scanned into the system So I said okay fine... Few days later the IPhone XR got delivered by UPS.. Didn’t open the box as I am returning it. Only time I held it when attaching new return package label sent by T-Mobile. The following morning the Package was dropped off at a UPS drop off location in Houston.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-7526588-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-7526588\"><p>Same day I placed a new order for an iPhone 11 128 gig via Customer Care and paid applicable tax and waited for my package to arrive. Three days later I have a notification from UPS that the iPhone 11 is for delivery. Waited all day ...by 8:15 pm that day I called UPS and told them that I will pick it up at the UPS location the following day. As I got there....UPS told me that they can not locate the package (IPhone 11 128 gig) but the status still for delivery. At that point I concluded It’s missing so I reported it to T-Mobile- I was on the phone with T-Mobile and UPS supervisor for 2 hours. As a summary of this ordeal it was determined that it got lost by UPS and I have to wait for a week to close the investigation before I will get my refund of the tax I paid for it. It never got delivered- got stolen as simple as that.</p><p>I ended up getting my IPhone 11 at the T-Mobile store as I don’t trust any more packages in the mail. To this date on the T-Mobile apps still saying that the lost package is for delivery which is ridiculous. So back to the IPhone XR. On December 2, 2019 I received a UPS notification that the tracking number for the XR package had been delivered at their Fort Worth Tx Warehouse. So I called customer care to verify if they received it. I was told by many customer care representatives that they don’t have it yet and that it will take weeks to get it scanned into the system. So I was being patient but it had gotten to a point where I was being lied to many times as to what happened to the IPhone XR package. </p><p>I got so fed up of their unprofessional treatments with me as they can not give me a straight answer. All I’m getting from them - \"we will initiate the investigation\" each time I call. They don’t like to talk to me anymore as if they put a star next to my name in their computer system like here comes the ** she’s calling again. A week before Christmas I called and ask for a supervisor with no result at all. The supervisor named Yvatt was rude and not very helpful at all. Two customer care representatives that I talked to seemed to be a little helpful but there’s nothing they can do to resolve the issue of finding the missing package. Telling me over and over again, \"We will continue to look for it.\" Bear in mind this a week before Christmas and my patience was about to run out. The answers I get each time I call -- They can not find the package that they will continue to look for it.</p><p>So by Jan 9, 2020 I called again and I talked to a customer care representative by the named of Bruce who seemed to be helpful at that time. I gave him the tracking information again and told me he will call me in about a week 1/16/20. He never did. So I called him with all the printouts of my tracking information and proof of delivery and who received it. He was extremely rude and unprofessional I was so shocked when this T-Mobile customer care representative Bruce told me that they found the box it’s empty and that I had returned an empty box. He then demanded that I returned the IPhone XR so they can close up the finance account as they were charging me for a device that I don’t have. Plain and simple T-Mobile accused me of stealing it, that I opened the box and keep the phone. I had the package clear taped around it so no one can tamper it or open it.</p><p>It took them a month and a half to tell me this. It's beyond belief. They claimed the box was found empty on December 9, 2019 and it took them over a month to give me this information. The fact that this item has been missing for awhile, T-Mobile did not take a picture of the outside of the box but only the inside once they found the package. Common sense to take a picture of the outside of the box to prove there is no tampering of this package. That is a missing package and you throw away the evidence. That tells you T-Mobile is covering up something, telling me they don’t have the box anymore. I can not prove that it was stolen in the warehouse as there is no picture of the outside box being tempered with. In a polite way, they want me to give the phone back to them which I don’t have. They even put a restriction on me to not starting an investigation with UPS as to what happen to the phone. That tells me something is not right.</p><p>If you order an iPhone get it at the store so you won’t end up in the same predicament like I did. To this date there is no resolution. The fact is I sent the phone. I have proof of delivery but doesn’t mean anything at all. All they are saying I have the missing phone and I sent an empty box. T-Mobile doesn’t care about customers unlike before when they have loyalty department.</p><p>T-Mobile relies their Texas Customers Service people who are very unprofessional. Supervisors are horrible. I can only remember a couple of the customer care representatives who are in a way helpful in the beginning however the rest I gave them a thumbs down. After a total of 15 years with T-Mobile it's time to move on. It’s not worth of my time. I can not deal any more stress with this company. A horrible experienced with them. I would not recommend T-Mobile for a phone provider especially if you lived in Houston, Texas. Customer Care is horrible. Outside Texas maybe okay. Also buy your phone at the store if you are happy with T-Mobile. However do not let them send to you by mail especially via UPS and avoid returning an iPhone to a T-Mobile warehouse Fort Worth if you don’t want to be in the same predicament like I did.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-7526588\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-7526588\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-7526588-btn\">\n",

She requested auto refill. At the time she complained they gave her no paper work. One month later she gets a message that her service has been suspended. Okay, I volunteered to go to a T-Mobile and find out what is going on. I talk to Yarron at a T-mobile store. He looks the account up and tells me -our account has been suspended, nothing he can do. I inform him that we were on automatic payment. He tells me -no we were not on automatic payment. I tell him that we were messaged by T-mobile that they received our money. He tells me Well, Mom’s account has been suspended. And suggests it was because she didn’t pay on time. I tell him we did pay on time because it was AUTOMATIC. He tells me -no we aren’t on automatic payment. I tell him we are and ask him -Then why/how did an automatic payment go through if we aren’t on automatic payment?</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-7465547-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-7465547\">\n",

      "                            I don’t know what he answered to that exactly but he clearly felt it was either our fault or perhaps the original T-mobile salesperson person.He wasn’t able to <p>hear me, believe me or understand me. I am not sure which. He stood, immovable and yet I wasn’t satisfied. My Mom paid her money, needed her cell tomorrow and he wasn’t interested in helping us unless we wanted to purchase a new service since the old one was suspended. I asked him to fix the problem and he told me it wasn’t his problem. I was confounded by that and showed my frustration by not accepting it. I said he and T-mobile had to do something. He told me that I was being rude to him. Which threw me. I wasn’t personally being rude to him but I was very frustrated. He told me that there was nothing he could do, there was no manager, that there was no action to be taken and I should leave.</p><p>So, here I was, knowing my Mom had paid for a cell service but had no service and was being told by this young man that it wasn’t their problem. I videotaped him from here which bothered him and he stopped momentarily telling me I was treating him badly and I was being rude. Okay so it was highly unpleasant. I went to my car and called T-mobile. I needed a pin, had to change the pin. Was asked for a new pin number of 6 digits. Changed it to a number I know well by the customer service person entering into it. This customer service person was difficult to understand, he mumbled, paused often, very difficult to follow but I think in retrospect he was saying “opted out” a lot. Basically he finally said that my bank or credit card or whatever was no good and I had to talk to the bank. I called my Mother and asked her to call the bank and drove home. </p><p>We confirmed the money had been paid by the credit card so we called T-mobile again. We went through the whole thing again (except he wanted our 4 digit pin number, the one I had changed) but it didn't work. Again the whole sending pin numbers etc. Once again we explain the facts, Mom signed up for T-mobile cell service and paid on December 10th. She asked for automatic payment for next month. Which she always does. Her credit card has been charged but the customer service representative Patrick told her that she’d have to wait for 72 hours to get her cell reinstated. </p><p>Patrick tells us that my Mom must have: Opted out of the automatic payment. Once again we explain if this was true, then why was her credit card charged. He agrees to look at this and find that yes, there was a payment. He claims WE must have paid the bill so it will take three days to reinstate the cell. We tell him we did not make a payment, that it was AUTOMATICALLY charged to our account because we have automatic payment. He repeats the same thing, up to 72 hours to get the cell back. We ask for a Manager. We get Sam B. He listens and says that we opted out just after we made a payment. We tell him over and over that we did opt out, ever, and we did not make a manual payment, that it was automatic, proving we did not opt out. He tells us that we MUST have opted out because no one at T-mobile could opt out. Okay, we believe him but still, there remains the fact that we also did not opt out. </p><p>So what happened? We don’t know and T-mobile isn’t interested in finding out, they just want to believe, somehow, we did opt out but aren’t telling the truth about it. He claims that the automatic charge and payment on the credit card isn’t proof we didn’t opt out. We must have used a refill card to make a payment. We didn’t, we never had a refill card, didn’t know they existed and the payment came from a credit card. We go around and around with Sam, maybe for 40 minutes? No apology, no acceptance of responsibility by T-mobile, no recourse offered. During all this he tells us that several times that T-mobile is undergoing an “unplanned service enhancement.” What the heck does that mean? More importantly, what does it have to do with our situation? Sam B. doesn’t say, he just repeats it like it is information that should clear everything up for us. </p><p>He also frequently says that we are not the only people calling today. That lots of people are having trouble and calling. Not as a way of explanation that pertains to anything or within context. Except as a way of inferring we were being inconsiderate, like we were taking up time that other people might need. He kept repeating this, as if being told we aren’t alone meant we shouldn’t be so difficult, like T-mobile was an Emergency Room and lots of people were in pain and we shouldn’t complain since lots of people were experiencing problems due to the “unplanned service enhancement” that their engineers were working on. I asked Sam B. him how T-mobile was going to make this up to us, that my Mom wouldn’t have service for up to 72 hours? Would there be a pro-rated credit? Would they change her start date. \"No,\" he said, \"no credit will be issued\". So, she is paying for a cell phone service she isn’t getting? That is fraud I think.</p><p>He even said that our issue has been noted but when I ask him what his notes say, he tells me his notes will say that he explained the situation to us. They should have just said the truth. What would be so hard about saying something like; “We’re experiencing technical difficulties, we’re working on it, we hope to have everything sorted out soon and we regret any inconvenience this situation might be causing you. If your service was interrupted due to any issues on our end, we will be prorating your bill.” Not try to disguise the issue and blame us for their issues or make us take responsibility for their issues. Just because T-mobile’s system is crashing isn’t our problem. I owe nothing to T-mobile. But T-mobile owes my Mother and I a lot. They promised my Mom cell service. Cell service she paid for. They did not tell us what was going on or even that they didn't know what the issue was. They didn't say they would investigate our issues. </p><p>They did not apologize for making mistakes or admit to any mistakes. Instead they told us they were undergoing a “unplanned service enhancement”. This sounds like a way to make their problems sound like a good thing. But it is obfuscation, pure and simple. A way to excuse themselves. A way to not take responsibility but also a way to make customers have to deal with issues that aren’t their problem. We get the run around while I’m told I’m rude, my Mom is told her credit card or bank has no funds, we told (accused) of opting out when we didn’t. We didn’t deserve the run around, the difficulty, stress and wasted time. I didn't deserve to be treated badly by Yarron. Everyone needs serious customer service training</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-7465547\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-7465547\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-7465547-btn\">\n",

Their service was poor in Tucson. I closed my account in November. This is January. To date, including November, I have been charged $370 for a closed account. I made calls every month asking for a refund and to close an account which they said was still open. They never closed that account until (maybe) January 7. Out of the $370 charged, they are refunding $90 and (supposedly) tracking a $80 refund (which seems to be non existent). So at the most, I'm being charged $370 minus $90 for a closed account.</p></div>, <div class=\"rvw-bd\"><span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">Original review: Jan. 7, 2020</span><p></p><p>So back in September I went in to the T-Mobile corporate store in Federal Way to inquire about the buy 1 get 1 promo on the Note10+ they were offering.

I was provided a written contract stating the total cost would be $150 per month for all 5 lines plus the cost of 1 phone and applicable taxes bringing the total cost to $189.50 for all 5 lines.

We recently changed our plan to the Military Magenta plan. S I am the veteran we also had to change ownership from my wife to me. This change took hours to complete. The first try the service rep was having connection issues so we tried back 2 days later. We then received 2 Bill's for December. One for the old account that was closed on the 9th (should have been the 7th except for the issue that there service had) for the full month and 1 for the new account prorated from the 9th. We spoke to the customer service who advised that we would not need to pay as we should get a new bill for the closed account. Today we received a call from their collection dept trying to get the whole month on the closed account. ANOTHER 2 HOURS on the phone again and all they can say is they understand and would we like to pay now?

My phone does not ring, there is no record of the person calling me. Sometimes I will get a text from somebody saying they are trying to call me. The # is a business #. I have no idea how many potential clients have tried to call me that did not make it through. Sometimes my voice mail engages, sometimes not. There have been days where I have verified, by looking at caller's phones, where I have missed over 50 calls in 1 day. This is not an exaggeration. Those trying to call me have gone in with me to the local T-Mobile store where they have displayed their call log and compared it to my phone. More than 50 calls In. One. Day. verified in front of the T-Mobile techs. Another day had 34 that we verified to the store techs. In every single case, T-Mobile opens a ticket and closes it in a few days. Just up and closes it. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-7444088-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-7444088\"><p>On one trouble ticket I actually managed to get confirmation from the tech that she tried to call me back 10 times, my phone never rang and never showed the missed calls. T-Mobile's response? They closed the ticket. Most recently (several months ago) I actually got connected with their backend support. They literally told me they have no idea what is going on, closed the ticket (as far as I can tell) and now refuse to respond to any communications I have sent. One incident over the 2019 Christmas/New Years holiday I have confirmed 14 calls in 1 day that never showed up on my phone.</p><p>Another effect of using T-Mobile that I have reported is when voice mails get left, often the voice mail does not show up for a while. On multiple occasions I have literally had people call me, ask if I had listened to the voice mail they left earlier or a previous day, only to have the voice mail show up while I am on the phone with them. In every case, T-Mobile did not care. One star is far too high of a rating.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-7444088\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-7444088\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-7444088-btn\">\n",

We on Tuesday, December 31, 2019, tried to use their computer chat system to sign up for new service. It didn’t work, so we talked on the phone. The representative told us we could get 3 lines for $100 if we prepay, which we did, and said the 3 sim cards would be delivered on Friday. So yesterday, Friday January 3, 2020, the cards arrive but there are only 2. We call and get a recording saying we’ll get a call-back in one hour. That did not sit well with me. We have a problem and their routine is to get back to customers in an hour—what if we weren’t free then? </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-7441631-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-7441631\"><p>In any case, they called. We (I say we because my wife and I took turns as this call went on and on) gave our info and our issue, talked a while, got put on hold, and then a different representative came on who knew nothing about our situation. We gave our info and told our story again, and again got placed on hold and then a different representative answered who knew nothing about our situation and we went through the routine again. This happened four times. We let the 4th know how unhappy we were. He assured us it wouldn’t happen again and put us on hold several times and kept coming back. He said over and over again, each time he returned, that the problem was that the payment was processed for two lines, not three. To T-Mobile, the fact we were mistakenly given two rather than three sim cards seemed an insurmountable problem that no one could possibly solve. </p><p>Finally, we said, \"Forget it—just give us a refund. We don’t want to deal with your company because we’ve never had such horrible customer service before.\" So he tried to refund our money. We are now 45 minutes into our call. He says he’s refunding it and then suddenly we’re on hold and a new guy comes on, a guy who knows nothing about the refund or our situation. He is very nice and apologetic, but he can’t in his dept. issue a refund, so he transfers us to person number 6, who does in fact issue us a refund (we hope—will have to see if it actually happens on our credit card). The call lasted an hour and 15 minutes. </p><p>Also, we asked person number 4 to get us the supervisor and were told the supervisor would talk with us, but that never happened. I cannot fathom how T-Mobile is a large, successful company with customer service like this. Apparently, if a customer has what the reps consider a difficult problem (like the wrong number of sim cards being sent), they just hang up and let a new person deal with the troublemaker. Unbelievable.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-7441631\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-7441631\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-7441631-btn\">\n",

Little did I know that after waiting 25 minutes for one of \"My Advisors\" to answer the phone that to qualify for any of the free plans, 55 plus or any special deals I would have to add another line or disconnect my service and sign back up again meaning I would lose the 3 phone numbers my wife and daughters have had for 9 plus years. After learning this I shopped around and settled on Verizon (great deal, knowledgeable staff and same monthly cost for unlimited).</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-7414019-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-7414019\"><p>So on Christmas day I attempted to port the 3 numbers that were important. I entered all the info needed including the T-Mobile account password but T-Mobile kicked it back as the wrong password, so I logged into my T-Mobile account (with the same password I tried 3 times). When I attempted to change the pin (couldn't remember it) T-Mobiles web site said it was messed up but should be fixed shortly. I then called the customer service number and requested a call back. After 2 hours and no call back I went in and requested an appointment call back (2 hours later) which did come but an hour late. I reset the pin and got the lines ported. Approximately 10 minutes late I received 2 emails, one signing me up for paperless billing and one with info to return the cell spot I had.</p><p>Keep in mind I still had an active phone line. Upon further inspection T-Mobile had sent the return kit to an address I had not been at for 2 years and turned off my ability to log into the account that they had just made paperless. Fast forward to the next day I walk into a corporate T-Mobile store to disconnect the 3 lines and just return the cell spot and after a 25 minute wait in line I am told I have to talk to customer service to cancel the lines and since I did not bring the Yellow Network cable they could not take the Cell spot. I left and called \"customer service and was told that the wait time was 10 to 12 minutes. 34 minutes later I finally had one of \"My Advisors\" on the line.</p><p>I explained everything that had transpired to this point and she put me on hold because on one side it showed the disconnect request on the other it did not. She came back and clarified that I wanted to close the 3 lines that were still open and once I agreed that was what I wanted she put me back on hold. After about 2 minutes she hung up the line (total time to get nowhere 47 minutes). I then grabbed the \"Yellow Cord\" and went to yet another Corporate store where I waited in line 35 minutes and after I explained again everything that had happened I was told they cannot take the cell spot back because a pickup request had already been issued (to the wrong address) but they would get customer service on the phone and have them email the shipping label and they would print it for me and give me a box.</p><p>They also told me that they could not disconnect the 3 lines but they would call and have it done for me. The young lady in the store was nice, but the first person never finished the disconnect request, so 45 minutes later I was told that the lines would automatically disconnect at the end of the billing cycle which ends Jan 1st so I am paying for 6 extra days on those 3 lines, cannot log into the account to pay the bill but was assured I would get a paper bill for my final bill. Hopefully it gets sent to the correct address and I can be done with this company. Sorry this was so long winded, but if you can get away from T-Mobile now DO IT.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-7414019\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-7414019\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-7414019-btn\">\n",

Well, what do you know? They sent me to collections over less than $200 dollars and now that I don't have a tmobile account I can't get ahold of anyone for help!!!! No call back request feature working and I've been on hold for over 2 hours trying to get ahold of someone. This is insane. My credit score is suffering because of these people. There is literally no option for me to get ahold of support. I hate this company. No one notified me at all if the auto-payment failed, I wasn't checking, why should I?

After several calls and promises that they'll to call back once they activate the so called \"escalation\", they never called and I concluded that they will never give me the free cost of the promotion. I'm even being told that that promotion never existed at the first place. The most disappointing fact is they keep promising to call back (after I spent many hours trying to get the problem resolved) but they never ever called back. When I called T-Mobile again all they tried to do is to offer more expensive plan instead of honoring what I was told on the phone. No more T-Mobile for me and my family (total 5 lines).</p></div>, <div class=\"rvw-bd\"><span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">Original review: Dec. 18, 2019</span><p></p><p>Switched from T-Mobile who has sent us no statements, closed access to account, yet continued to bill us.

Not so, they neglect to tell you that does not include taxes and fees. I get the 1st bill and it is $73.00. I called to find out how a $55.00 bill got to $73.00. Well, they explain that with the taxes and fees it is $63.00. I said \"ok, but how did I get to $73.00?\" The customer service rep tells me I am paying $10 for increased Data boost (or something like that). I tell her take that off, I don't need that. \"Well, if you have the 55 essential and do not add the extra $10 for the data boost, you essentially have no data at all.\" They give you such a low LTE that you cannot access anything.

This information was not given to us verbally or in writing when we signed up for our plan.

HOWEVER, I finally switched to ATT because believe it or not they were less expensive than T-mobile. The ATT rep came to my house and ported all my phones and then I added a line to cover my iPad that I had on the Tmobile plan as well. My complaint is simple. The second my Tmobile number was ported I lost the APP that I did everything with, with Tmobile. I expected to get another bill from Tmobile for my wife's phone (pay off device). I left the auto pay set up with no worries. I received a bill, and threw it away expecting it was the device payoff. 2nd month comes by I received another bill, didn't think nothing of it and tossed it out (difference in any charges), again I'm set up on auto pay. Knew it was being taken care of. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-7383653-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-7383653\"><p>3RD bill hits, I open it up and see I'm still being charged $70 a month for an iPad plan that has had 0 data used for the last two months and the $30 a month bill for the wife's phone ($100) total. So I see I have paid $200 for the last 2 months. $140 on a service that has used 0 data and $60 on a phone I expected to pay. I think no big deal let me call up T mobile and get this solved...ATT just didn't cancel the number correctly.</p><p>Call T-Mobile.... Long story short... I don't want any refund of money or any money back. I would just like $60 of the $140 I spent for data on a plan that should have been cancelled two months ago to be applied to my $60 bill that I have left on my phone so it is paid off and for the service to be cancelled. Instead I am informed they will waive the next two $70 bills I am supposed to pay (??? for services I never used). But they can't do anything about the $140 for the services I already used (their words.. \"We don't bill you for the use of the service. We bill you for having access to it and you had access to it, you just didn't use it\"). </p><p>And they won't credit me anything for the $60 remainder phone balance. So I wanted to make sure my service is cancelled and have them apply $60 to my phone bill of the $140 I feel I paid in excess. They say they provided a service.. I never cancelled.. doesn't matter if I didn't use a single mb of data.. I get it. They are right. But here is my review.</p><p>I'm in customer service and if you want to lose a customer for life and all of his friends who care to read his review and care about his opinion over $60 on a technicality, (ok here's your bad review). Instead of just saying, yes I see you haven't used our services in over 3 months and you have paid for it. We have no problems refunding you $60 of what you paid and closing out your account. That's all I wanted. Instead I'm told they are waiving the next two bills ($140) but I still owe the $60. Guys just because you can do something doesn't mean you should. Sometimes the right move is simply saying life happens. We get it and care, look forward to doing business in the future. Merry Xmas. We took care of that for ya.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-7383653\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-7383653\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-7383653-btn\">\n",

That remains useless if you're looking to upgrade your phones. All promotions are for new customers. But they reassured me that if I add another line that I absolutely do not need since I already have 4, then I can get some kind of deal. Being a loyal customer just isn't worth it. You're better off canceling your account with them and restarting with a different customer or even them again to get the best deals. They also love to hide fees from you. Today I asked about an Iphone-11 Pro. I asked what would be my cost out of pocket today. Their response was $279.00. No problem, I was ready ready to pay to their statement of \"do you authorize T-Mobile to charge your account $345.00?\" Yes, they throw extra taxes on top at the last moment.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-7379696-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-7379696\"><p>I was also going to purchase the basic IPhone-11.

If I canceled my account with them and rejoined as a new customer, I would be offered free phones, or heavy discounts with certain trade ins. As previously mentioned, there's no incentive to staying with them after. I'm fed up with large corporations only wanting new customers to up their sales but do nothing to keep the loyal existing customers equally important as the new.

I chatted online, gave all my information, discussed my corporate discount, and all things said and done I'd be getting 3 brand new iPhone 11's for a grand total of right around $135.00, needless to say I was very happy with this and ready to switch. I was told the corporate discount was an easy process, that they match existing ones, and to call and give them the information, cool. The rep told me there would be some sort of fee per line to switch, but then I wouldn't get a bill for over a month, sounds good. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-7360181-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-7360181\"><p>The fee up front was $60.00, I paid that. Then the new phones got shipped to me, the setup process and moving them from Sprint was all seamless. I wasn't told how to get my old existing phones back to T-Mobile for the reimbursement, so I had to call yet again, someone was helpful. Took down the info and said they'd be sending the shipping label. I then had to buy my own box which wasn't a big deal, but they mail it off. </p><p>Then I wanted to get the corporate discount squared away. I called again, and was told no, they need a copy of the old bill showing the discount and to bring it to a branch. I do so and I get told I need to submit it to a certain website. The website I was directed to made no mention of uploading the document, only to visit a store. I call again and they said I need to explain it to the branch better and to go back. Great. I go back a second time, to be told I don't have the magenta plan, and the discount could not be applied. Awesome.</p><p>I call back and explain my whole deal, also what I was promised by the sales rep I chatted with originally, the $135.00 as the total bill, they were pretty surprised by this amount I was expecting but said once the old phones are received and the credits and everything issued we'll revisit it. A week or so goes by and I see a charge about about $120 as a bill.

We received message that porting was completed but were unable to make or receive calls. I spent hours on the phone and online chats with agents trying to correct this issue to no avail. The agent that activated our service was off on Monday so I waited until Tuesday 11/12/19 to revisit the store for assistance.

Our complaint is about the phones they sell. We always protected our phones with covers and take care with them. If you pay $600 plus for a phone, they should last a minimum of 4-5 years. Our phone purchases in the last 6 years have never lasted over 2 years. They fall apart, warp, quit working as reasonably expected. Our old flip-phones from years ago were completely operable and intact after 5 years when we upgraded to a smartphone. It has been downhill ever since. In addition, the insurance is practically worthless, which we only purchased once, as we requested a replacement smartphone when it cratered under warranty and they wanted to replace with $100 phone. I don’t know if this is a systemic problem throughout the carrier industry, but we the consumers are paying the outrageous price for a product that doesn’t last as long as a coffee maker.</p></div>, <div class=\"rvw-bd\"><span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">Original review: Dec. 8, 2019</span><p></p><p>In-store I was told about a buy 1 get 1 free deal that T-Mobile had on the Samsung Galaxy e10; as I was looking for a new phone. I figured why not, and went through the process of buying the phones, the sales rep knew the deal was the only reason I got 2 phones and knew that we were not adding lines or changing anything about our contract, and said nothing about us not being eligible. After the first 2 bills, I noticed a discrepancy, that we were being charged for both phones in full. When I called t-mobile I was told that I didn't qualify for that deal as you had to add 2 new lines. So I questioned why the sales rep offered when he knew we weren't adding lines, and why he never said anything through the entire process of buying the new phones. The answer was of course \"bait and switch\", cause now they can charge full price for both, and I'm stuck with it. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-7346873-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-7346873\"><p>I filed a complaint about the bait and switch and was contacted by a representative from t-mobile, after speaking with him it was agreed on that I would receive a credit for one of the Samsung galaxy e10 phones, as I was promised the deal, I didn't want more than that, just what I was promised.

That Call Forwarding was not on that phone as of December 6, 2019....one and half year of MISSED SALES &amp; CLIENT PHONE CALLS! The other thing is their deceptive business practice of LURING YOU WITH FREE EQUIPMENT. The sales person will explain the items are charged to your account but a credit will also be applied to offset the charge thus, making them free. What they do not tell you is that the credit is spread out over (commonly) 24 months. If you end the contract with T-Mobile before that time, the balance will have to be paid. I understand the purpose behind it as to avoid people just getting the free stuff then cancelling in a month.

In three different locations where I live I could not get signal. In one location a fatality accident occurred right in front of my house, I had to run 100 yards down the road just to call 911. I looked on the signal map and it showed I had great coverage. My data signal was as slow as 80's dialup speed. I moved to another location less than 2 miles from the City Center of a population center of over 100,000 people. Even with the signal booster T-Mobile mailed me I could not get signal, again to make a call I had to walk or drive down the road until the bars came up to one or two.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-7320440-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-7320440\"><p>Now I am in a different city in a different state and my signal measured on a meter is so low as to be unusable. I have to steal signal from my neighbors for any internet and my phone calls tend to go to voice mail as they cannot get through to me. The tower is less than 8 miles away according to the FCC map I got. Two of my phones are with my kids at their schools. They have great coverage. I tend to travel a lot and cannot count the times when I leave a metro area and end up without signal for miles while actually on I-84 or I-5 highway.</p><p>I have spend countless hours with T-Mobile tech support and they just keep saying that I should be getting a great signal, I purchased a new phone at their suggestion to get the new frequencies, All a waste of money and time. T-Mobile consistently lies about their coverage and signal quality. They promise the world and deliver nothing. I would estimate that I have zero signal at least 50% of the time and degraded signal the rest.</p><p>They will not compensate me for this poor quality. I would go to another carrier but the prices are ridiculous for one line here is 90 bucks a month from their competitors. If I had the budget I would bolt from this company. If you live in an area where signal is heavy, great. If you are not in the areas they want to develop (high density urban housing) then you are screwed and you are financing someone else's great service while you watch the raster scans of your device slowly load a picture or the never ending wagon wheel of buffering.

When we called customer service to inform them of our intent to change, they were very solicitous and asked if there was anything they could do to encourage us to stay. We laid out the Spectrum plan, pointing out we would save over 50% compared to our T-Mobile account, and even with paying installments on 2 new iPhone11s we are still saving over 35% each and every month. At that point the agent became downright surly and completely lost her pleasant voice and demeanor.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-7319954-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-7319954\"><p>We called T-Mobile to help in the transfer of numbers so that we could keep our existing numbers on the new service. They were less than pleasant and did as little as possible to help in that transition process. And Buyer Beware - if you go 1 day into a new billing cycle they will make you pay for the entire month, even after they have turned off your service. \"It is in the contract\" was the only explanation given. T-Mobile has gotten so large and corporate that they no longer have any connection or interest in their individual customers. As long as you keep funneling money to them, they are tolerable, but not interested in being particularly of service.</p><p>My wife and I are retired, and we needed to wait until the first of the month to get funds in to pay the bill each month. For the entire two years of our contract we were a couple days past the listed due date, but we never had a problem with them hassling us for the payment. Now that we have cancelled service, they sent a Collection Agency after us within the a couple of days after the due date. No attempt to contact us via phone or email (all info they had from our account file). It seemed an unnecessarily petty gesture and we will file a grievance if it registers as negative mark on our credit report. It is not just the corporate disinterest in their customers that is so upsetting, it is the obviously petty and parsimonious mindset that seems so pervasive in the entire corporate structure. We are so happy to be away from them.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-7319954\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-7319954\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-7319954-btn\">\n",

In July of 2018, my grandmother purchased a brand new phone for me as a birthday gift with her credit card (Fully paid off). For a year, the bill was always consistent and I never had anything to complain about. Fast forward to September of 2019, and I transfer the account out of my grandmother's name to mine, so that I can start receiving the credit for paying this bill off in full every month on time.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-7308503-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-7308503\"><p>The problems started when I get the text notification that my bill for the month is due and I see that it's $70. That's a $10 increase compared to what I'd been paying for an ENTIRE year. Now my previous bill went from $60-$65 without them sending me a notice or even bothering to call me. But, like the lazy ** I was, I didn't call. I should have. I get on the phone with someone, and she has the nerve to tell me that $10 increase was taxes. If she could've seen my face, she would've realized she was as dumb as I thought she was. Absolute bull, and I told her just as much before I requested to speak with a supervisor since she insisted on sticking to her story!</p><p>Supervisor gets on the line after fifteen minutes and tells me that the reason my bill has been increasing for the past few months was because my grandmother never paid off the phone in full. So apparently, without disclosing any of this to her when she bought the phone, T-mobile had not only put her on a finance plan, but entered her in for the auto-pay as well without saying so much as a word. After a very long conversation with Michael disputing everything, he takes off the remaining balance for the phone, promises to make sure I receive the correct billing going forward, and gives me a $25 credit for the current bill. Excellent customer service and I was very happy. Even thanked him for taking the time to listen and explain where all this was coming from.</p><p>Fast forward maybe a 1 1/2-2 weeks later, I have to call again because they sent my grandmother to a collection agency for non-payment on some charge we didn't even know existed. No phone call, text, letter, or email to inform us. After a very long, painful conversation where the rep Sara kept addressing my grandmother inappropriately the entire time until she finally snapped, and speaking with a supervisor, the issue was fixed. And even though I asked for confirmation that this nightmare was over, all I received was gibberish and a bunch of links that went nowhere important. But, at this point, I was so tired of speaking to these people that I thanked them and said goodbye.</p><p>Fast forward to my bill for the month, and it is yet again $70, even though I'd already went over everything with Michael and was told I'd be paying $65 a month. I'm over it. I call for what I'd hoped would be the last time and asked if I would incur any fees for cancelling my service and moving to another carrier. I was told no. Which was a lie, but that's a story for another time. Pay day came, I went to the nearest AT&amp;T store, and walked out with a brand new iPhone and a better understanding of customer service. And even though my new bill is 2x the amount of my old one, I'm still happy because they were upfront and honest with me. AT&amp;T has yet to break their word or cause me a great deal of stress. I will never use T-Mobile again, nor will I recommend anyone else put themselves through the risk of this being done to them.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-7308503\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-7308503\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-7308503-btn\">\n",

Dropped calls. Strange noises. No audio. I dealt with it, knowing I would soon be moving. The entire state of WV is a dead spot. I found that out when I had problems with the moving truck. It's even worse in Greensboro, NC. Cloudy days I get no signal. They would constantly forget to notify me that a payment was due, and instead just shut the phone off.

I set up what I thought was a great plan and was told the phones would be in mail that week. After 5 days I called to ask when our phones would be shipped, I was told that my new account was canceled. When I asked why it was cancelled, they said that it was a glitch in their system. They said to go to a T-Mobile store with a reference number of which they gave me in order to reorder. 2 hours later I was in the store, and after an hour of trying to figure out my account number since the store and the online do not have the same computer, I found out that my account was not canceled. I was told that I was going to get the phones on Monday Nov 18.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-7287467-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-7287467\"><p>Today, on Wednesday November 20th I called the same store that helped me days before, and they told me that yes they can help me and to come on in. When I got to the store the same woman I talked to on phone said she can't pull up my account and there was nothing she can do. She tried to get me to set up a brand new account to run my credit again and I said no thank you.</p><p>I went into the car and I called customer service again of which after an hour conversation three times being told that my account is fine and three times being told my account was canceled and even one time I was told that the phones were still on their way (all in one call). Finally by the end they said no there was a back door that was canceled for whatever reason, and because of all the issues I was having if I was still willing to go with them they would take the startup $20 fee off of each phone. They told me to go to a specific T-Mobile store of which they were sending all the information to.</p><p>When I got there they had no idea what I was talking about, they couldn't find my account number and when they called customer service from store they said that there was no way that I would be able to have that $20 fee per phone waived. I tried to call customer service again about it and found out that they have canceled all my information. This has been a headache for sure and I'm not really sure what the managers are doing about this kind of horrible customer service.

Second, after we were cancelled for about a month we got an auto withdrawal for the same monthly amount as usual.

Low price plans are great but not worth it if I can't communicate with the people who need me most in an emergency.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-7131182\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-7131182\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-7131182-btn\">\n",

But in the notification, there is no way for you to get details and you are only allowed to either: 1) accept their lie 2) have the phone returned to you; which means you are no longer given the promotion since it hinged on a trade-in and you will pay full price for the phone since you are already using it and it's now one day past 14 days since you set up the line. </p><p>T-Mobile rep responded by crediting my account $13 (the amount the trade-in value had dropped due to completely fictitious reason).

The chat rep ended up calling me direct and selling me on the Verizon switch plan. The phone I wanted to buy was not going to be available for about 10 days, but I was assured that our account would not be activated until we received our equipment. I was also assured that they would make sure that we had our promotional gift card to pay off our last bill with Verizon (THIS IS NOT TRUE _ THE GIFT CARDS WILL NOT COME TO YOU UNTIL 8 WEEKS AFTER YOU SWITCH - If you owe any money on your current phones you will have to eat that cost and carry it for 2 months!!!!) Believe me - if this had been explained to me properly in the initial sales call - had I been given info to read and digest I would never had proceeded with this company. But as you can probably tell this information was not provided to me. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-7102364-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-7102364\"><p>Fast forward 3 days and I receive an email activation for my new account (no equipment had been received). I immediately called customer care and was bounced around to 3 representatives over a period of 40 minutes - each one not able to help. I was also \"disconnected\" and had to call back to get to the 3rd representative!! I continually asked to speak with a manager, and was finally given a manager who told me that we would not be charged until our equipment arrived. Our equipment did arrive sooner than promised which was great, but when I went to the store to activate and port our old numbers over I was told that I could not do that in the store because my order was online. </p><p>At this point I decided to cancel and return the equipment - this is just not worth the hassle - I called customer care again with a similar experience - 3 different reps and \"disconnected\" from one during the initial call. I finally go on with ANOTHER manager who issued me a return shipping label for my equipment. At that point he told me that I would get an email when the equipment was received and my refund would be processed. My equipment was received this past Friday - NO EMAIL CONFIRMATION!! I called customer service AGAIN - no one could tell me why I didn't see that confirmation - that their computer systems have been down all weekend?! WHAT?? And guess what - I was \"disconnected\" again from the first person that I talked to. I finally got a resolution to be on the lookout for the email Monday morning (today).</p><p>The email came through around 10am, and all was well until I walked to my mailbox and pulled out a bill for service from the point I received the email that my account had been activated through November of the same date!!!! I was told during the sales process I would not receive a bill until November. Now typing this review I am sitting with customer service AGAIn - I waited the first time for 15 minutes - got on with a rep who conveniently \"disconnected\" the call right as we were trying to determine why I would want to cancel my account? Now I have called back and am on hold (15 minutes into the 2nd call back). This should be illegal - they do not sell you the right plan up front and then good luck trying to get any resolution from anyone that works at this company - no one in the store can help you if you buy online....

The payment should have been processed at the time of giving order. However it got processed 3 weeks later and coincidentally my credit card stopped working at the time due to some security issue and which can happen, though at the time of placing the order it was active and working fine.</p><p>They never bothered to call me to take some other credit card number or payment details instead cancelled the order without my knowledge, I was waiting for it for a month and I placed the order a month before, they processed the payment 3 weeks after. I can’t have control on my cc and my banks can block it temporarily due to security issue and I don’t keep track of each cc.</p><p>Reason 2 - When I called customer care, I talked to 3 different levels for a duration of an hour, they don’t seems efficient to solve my problem and were forcing me to have a new order without that initial $350 deal, the manager, supervisor were all acting stupid, no customer care etiquettes and unprofessional people!, I was so pissed with their slow response and then inefficiency. They didn’t try to understand my problem and started arguing with me.</p><p>Reason 3 - go to any of their stores and their customer service is the slowest with quite untrained people and not more than 2. I waited for more than a hour though there were none in front of me and the two people were being served in the slowest possible way!</p><p>Reason 4 - I am an electronics/ network communication engineer, they have weak networks everywhere and the calls drop most of the time or dc while talking, their service is not worth to be paid that much each month, there are better networks like AT&amp; T or Verizon, which are quite stable and reliable. TMOBILE is the most unreliable and unstable network than any... I am being with them for more than 15 years and now looking for another network to move all my lines.

Call 1: Oct 11, 2019 4:22pm. Spoke to representative regarding upgrading 2 phones with no down payment. Representative spoke to manager, stated they received an approval for the 256gb, we asked to check on the 512gb.

We were transferred to a manager Mickie, in the middle of the conversation, the call drops. No call back from the manager. Call 3: Oct 12, 2019 1:48pm. On this call we were transferred to a representative located in Tampa Fl. He was extremely nice. He confirmed he that he saw the comments in the account, he could not do that and spoke to a manager. The managers listened to the calls and they confirmed what we were asking for was what was promised to us. They notified the original managers and rep, to contact us and get this resolved. No call...</p><p>Call 4: Oct 13, 2019 8:15pm. We called back and we spoke rep, Adrian. They approved to put the order through without down payment. The down payment would then show in the account and they have an \"empowerment\" to remove the charges and that's what would be done. An email with the contract would be emailed to me. Down payment was there and only 1 ph showing. Call 5: Oct 14, 2019 4:03pm. Spoke to Andre and Mike, Mike had the original team call us back. Call 6: 6:04pm. Adrian, stated there was nothing they could do they escalated to a manager. Same Adrian who made the promise on call 4 and guaranteed t-mobile was taking care of it.

I want 2 Galaxy Note 10+ with no down payment. If down payment is added as part of ordering process I want T-Mobile to refund that amount back to my original form of payment. I want T-Mobile to do right by a loyal customer (15 years).

Here is my experience: 1) The waiting time for CHAT is long. 2) The CHAT agents' service is poor. 3) Example of my yesterday's experience: the agent is not professional and is extremely slow. In average, I had to wait for 5-6 minutes for her answer. She did not answer my specific questions, instead, she just typed short general info from the web. After a couple of questions, she sent me links for me to fill in my personal info to join TMobile. I told her that I wanted to understand the plan and the service first. Then she disappeared without answering any questions anymore, without saying \"anything else I can help\", as all other CHAT services would do. The CHAT experience makes me fear to transfer to Tmobile.</p></div>, <div class=\"rvw-bd\"><span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">Original review: Oct. 12, 2019</span><p></p><p>Everyone I have ever spoken to at T-Mobile has been nice. Customer service and tech support is stellar. But even though I live in a 4GLTE area proudly advertised by T-Mobile as having \"good\" coverage on their map, I get terrible slow unreliable service. I live in a city, not a rural area. My service is unusable inside my home. My home is concrete block construction, which is not unusual in many parts of the country. I have trees in my yard, which are normal, or so we would hope.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-7048766-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-7048766\"><p>My download speed is around 1.5 Mbps with my upload speed around 0.10 Mbps. I had to walk outside to get that reading as inside my home I get no reading. Since I have prepaid and not postpaid, John Legere has not given us any protection against robocallers. Spammers have made Wifi calling impossible. Just because a phone company has \"coverage\" means nothing. Coverage is meaningless if you can only get one unusable bar.</p><p>They will pay you lots of lip service in attempts to get you to stay, but what matters is that the phone service sucks. Moral: Even if it says you are \"covered\" it doesn't mean anything. They are just as expensive as the other carriers. I have had them for years and put up with it for years, but no more. I am looking elsewhere.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-7048766\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-7048766\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-7048766-btn\">\n",

You get a phone, put it inside a phone case, have it break less than 30 days later and they refuse to trade it back because they have such crappy guarantees. They last only 14 days. Like really? You think I am going to figure everything out on my new phone and see if there are any problems by then to report a problem. The second experience was with ANOTHER PHONE that lasted no longer than a year replacing it over 5 TIMES!!! Each time having to pay them 5 dollars to replace THEIR FAULTY PHONE! From problems with the GPS not working, screen burning, to physical warping of the phone due to heat they expect me to pay for the new refurbished one. If you are wondering it was the LG G5. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-7047077-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-7047077\"><p>Now recently I found out they were charging me for a tablet that they gave to me for FREE as part of a \"free promotion\" for said crappy phone. Not using it for years cause I already had another tablet. Found out they were charging me for it. They won't return my money cause the \"promotion rebate has closed out\". \"They,\" said you needed to go on the website to claim the promotion. Yep sure the only thing they told me was to mail in a 50 dollar rebate for the phone which wasn't even from them but the manufacturer. I think one of their employees set up the promotion as a transaction so he would get more commission off of it than if I was getting it for free. I'm done with these people. I'm going to find another carrier that won't be treating me like absolute garbage. If they ever want me to recommend them they might have to dig up my corpse and puppeteer my body for that to happen!</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-7047077\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-7047077\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-7047077-btn\">\n",

I recently experienced the worst and most unprofessional customer service from the company T-Mobile that I have experienced in my entire life. The company currently is employing the worst of the worst when it comes to their choice for staffing employees. They offer nothing but poor customer Service. The customer service department is very argumentative, they do not believe in satisfying the customer needs or offering quality customer service, in fact they do not believe that the customers is always right. Their attitude is that they right and you the customer are not..

Do Not use T-Mobile as your phone service provider. You will only regret your decision.

Then the rep went on to tell me that they have the cheapest international rates in the market. This is simply untrue, after a quick google search I found that Verizon has a rate of $1.99 and an option to add an international plan for $5, instead of the $15 that T-Mobile charges.

Early in June I cancelled all of my service. However, the agent I spoke with failed to cancel one of the lines and I received another bill the next month for the full family data plan and one line. I called to dispute the bill and the agent assured me that I would be credited and not to worry about it. A month later, I got billed for another month!

When I call T-Mobile they keep asking for pin # which I don't have. They cannot help me without pin # and store people won't talk to me.

I was told by a person who called to send the phones back to T-mobile through FedEx which I did well. T-mobile won't refund my money till they get their stupid phones back. They also charged me for two extra lines that I did not purchased. I have talked to 12 reps and all I get is the same ** line saying, \"We can't help you.\" Yet I filed a fraud report with them and with my bank also a police report.

We were looking for a reasonable phone plan in our area for unlimited data, text, phone for 55+. We saw T-Mobile had a $90 plan for the 2 of us. We are located in a remote area of The Thumb in Michigan; so we called T-Mobile to ask about this plan, if our area was in their network, and to place an order based on our findings.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-6901670-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-6901670\"><p>We were connected to a sales person on Saturday, August 30, 2019 in New York. He walked us through a great deal that we jumped on for $90 a month billing with no taxes. He told us he'd send us two phones with sim cards; we'd receive them by Tuesday and we could set them up with no problems. He guaranteed us T-Mobile had service at our address. Wish he did his homework better because now begins our nightmare.</p><p>Upon receiving the two new phones on Tuesday as he told us, we installed the sim cards and called T-Mobile customer service to set them up. We could NOT get a signal. We could not use these phones to place this call. The guy we talked to this time on Tuesday said we DO NOT GET SERVICE AT OUR ADDRESS! So why did the guy in New York tell us we did?</p><p>T-Mobile may be able to offer service for our zip code, but not at our address and that doesn't help us. So, this 2nd person we spoke to called the Shipping Department and this 3rd person (a woman) sent us a return address label via email and with instructions from both these people (2nd and 3rd) we were in touch with, we packaged the phones up in the same box, placed the return shipping label on the box and prepared it for UPS shipment. This box went out UPS on Friday, August 30, 2019. It was tracked and received in Fort Worth, TX, on Thursday, September 5 (after Labor Day) at the T-Mobile dock as it should.</p><p>It is now Monday, September 23, 2019, and we have no refund of the $74 for sim card charges and T-Mobile is billing us for one month of usage! We never were able to use these phones, but now are getting billed for usage. My significant other has called T-Mobile many times and they claimed they haven't located the phones and they claim the account is being charged monthly. He asked to talk to a supervisor and got hung up/disconnected numerous times trying to resolve this issue, explaining to every new person he'd get the problem which never ended in a solution so he asked me to try.</p><p>I contacted my first T-Mobile person down in the Texas on Wednesday, September 18. I explained the situation and gave her the order #, account #, UPS tracking #, both phone numbers they gave us, everything I had. She was able to open up TWO research orders instead of just the one that someone else opened AND she put in the detailed information of the UPS tracking #. She also saw and understood that we never used these phones and that we were erroneously being charged for an account that was never actually put into usage. She said she would call my significant other back 4 days later. That call never came on Sunday, September 22. I had no clue why.</p><p>Now, it is Monday, September 23 and I placed a call again to T-Mobile and was connected to Miranda in Idaho. Idaho happens to do the training for T-Mobile. She looked at everything using our order # and said that on Thursday, September 19 the review department looked at this issue and a return order was finally set up stating the phones had been returned. However, some newbie dismissed this issue at the next step seeing that this account was in usage without ever reading any notes!</p><p>You can imagine how someone 63 feels when they keep hearing of the incompetence of the employees our issue falls into the hands of and how they will just dismiss it without any further investigation because they are either new or too lazy or incompetent to do their jobs correctly! Really now? What does one have to do to get proper handling of a situation like ours? Certainly, and through no fault of our own, a refund has still not been made or this account closed to this date because T-Mobile employees lack the proper experience to understand an issue and follow through the correct procedures. The two women I have talked with in Texas and Idaho have been conscientious and knowledgeable and the only ones that seem willing to help us.</p><p>Today, while talking to Miranda, she was going to talk to the order support team located across the hall from her. She put me on hold and eventually I must've been on hold too long because my call went back into the queue and some younger customer service person answered it with \"Can I help you?\" and I tried to tell him I need to go back to the Idaho office to Miranda who had me on hold. He couldn't do that of course so I am back to trying to get someone in the United States by calling the customer service number again. I was waiting over 15 minutes twice already and got someone overseas each time and told them I need to call back and now I will not be calling back because the wait is 30 minutes!</p><p>So, folks, if you are 55+ and looking for this same T-Mobile plan, go to Verizon because that is what we had to do. They offer a similar plan for $45 up to two people but you have to have an IL, FL or MO address. I am from IL and am using my family address there. I get great reception out here on The Thumb with Verizon. Got none with T-Mobile. We tried to do the right thing, tried to get what we thought would be a great plan at our age only to be told erroneous information and now are getting ripped off because of it. T-Mobile got their phones back, but we are still getting billed on an account never used with no refund for phones or account closed properly, T-Mobile has done nothing for us but given us grief and aggravation. What can we do? No one that can seem to resolve this issue.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-6901670\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-6901670\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-6901670-btn\">\n",

Of course, once you’re with them, you are excluded from many special promotions, or they create offers that guarantee new customers will buy in while existing customers will get screwed!

I got the message that I was using too much, called (on wifi) to ask what I could do and was told basically nothing--there's no way to BUY coverage on top of the generous international roaming plan. When I got home, they PERMANENTLY withdrew my international roaming privilege!! Three concerns: When the criterion is a percentage and you’re out of the country through a billing period, ANY usage—1kb—is over 50%. They make it sound like it's amount, but it's entirely about percentage. If you're only out of the country for PART of a billing cycle, the \"watch lots of videos\" idea works, but if you're international through an entire billing cycle, ONE call to Uber=100% and puts you in violation.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-6723665-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-6723665\"><p>In that situation, the lack of an add-on international calling package as an option means T-mobile doesn’t allow people like me to “do the right thing” even when we offer to do so. It creates a corporate “gotcha.” (If T-mobile offers daily or monthly international usage plans, they didn't tell me about them when I inquired, but I'd still love to know. They offer a SUPPLEMENTAL plan on TOP of the free plan to get faster coverage, but no temporary plan for long international trips that I know about. Glad to find out differently.</p><p>Permanent revocation of the privilege when there is no “approved” recourse is not in the spirit of the “uncarrier” at all. As you can tell, more than aggravated I’m just disappointed. At least in this situation, T-mobile is not who they say they are. Really love lots of things about the company, but in this instance they are not the \"uncarrier\"--they are TOTALLY \"corporate.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-6723665\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-6723665\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-6723665-btn\">\n",

Only problem is everytime I enter my password it is incorrect yet when I try to set my password (using the same password I always use and tried to log in with) they tell me I can't change my password to what it currently is.

But later received a bill and called to find out that the account was still open with lines that were transferred to another carrier. So then I had to pay yet another bill and \"cancel\" service yet again. Oh yeah, they cancel your account account so you cannot log in and see your bill (for yourself) and pay it. When you call they cannot update your address to send you the final bill and it seems that emailing it is off the table, as well.

The service has been so so, depends on where you are. I have no reception at all at my house (1 bar and drops every call) and I am in a town of 100,000 in the bay area. Over all I could deal with the sketchy service but anytime they come out with a new promotion it is geared only toward new customers. So let's forget about the current customers that keep the lights on every month and pay the employee salaries and let's put all our promo money into new customers instead that may or may not stay!! Brilliant marketing plan!! So we needed new phones because we have the Apple 7 phones that only have 16 GB of memory and with all the Apple update there is not enough room on the phone. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-6662329-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-6662329\"><p>So I called customer service to see if there was anything they could do to get us two new Apple XR phones (2 out of our 4 lines) and they talked about special programs that we could get like 400.00 as trade ins. I said thats all you can do, they said yes. So we started to look around at other carriers and happen to be at the mall and we said to ourselves that if they gave us 400 bucks for each of our phones that would be half off a new phone. Not as good as being a new customer and getting a free phone but would be less hassle, no start up fees with a new customer sign ups etc. So we went into a T-Mobile store and they offered us like 100.00 for each phone, WHAT A JOKE. </p><p>One hand doesn't know what the other hand is doing. The two people helping us had no knowledge of the new iPhone nor what happens when you change plans etc because we have one free line so we just wanted to know if we change plans would we still get the free line or not. One person said yes the other said no, NICE, we have no idea. So we went ahead and spent like 850.00 on a new iPhone which they were giving to new customers because we figured we own it and we could just port our number when we change carriers. </p><p>The next day we received a survey to ask what we thought of or visit to the store so I answered it honestly. About a week later I get a call from T-Mobile customer service asking about my survey which I thought was great they cared enough to call!! About a minute into the call it dropped due to bad service, doesn't look to good when you are on the phone with a cell phone provider and the call drops! I figured they would call back, NEVER DID, NICE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! As of now we are just waiting for the best deal to come along for ATT or Verizon.

Today was the third and final attempt to work out a better family plan with T-Mobile after being their customer for over seven years.. Four years on a different plan with my daughter and the past three years under my name with my sons. I tried and tried and they refuse to give any new promos to their existing customers! Only new customers get the best deals. Existing customers get squat! It does not matter if you speak with the customer service rep Supervisor or even Corporate. They do not care that you have been their loyal customer whatsoever, they have proven this time and time again! So not stick with or go with T-Mobile unless you enjoy being treated like nothing and paying higher prices than you have to. They have been also ripping off my daughter with the military plan that is supposed to be 50% off making her pay even higher than I have been paying for three lines, for over two years now!</p></div>, <div class=\"rvw-bd\"><span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">Original review: Aug. 3, 2019</span><p></p><p>All I wanted to do was switch plans. 90 minutes in the store and their own representatives couldn't get customer service on the line.

The person inshore said he has made the change in plan for all the lines so I went off and trusted them that the change is made. The bill is on autopay so I never checked it, unit before few days, I gave bill as document proof and realized, they changed the plan for only 1 line and DID not change for rest 3 lines. The added services on top of it at random times.

The customer service rep was very arrogant and said he can not do anything. If I want I can take the 180 credit or else nothing can be done. Most pathetic service ever. I am planning to pursue legal complaint so they do not do fraud in billing with other customer ever.

So we purchase 2 s10 and the promo is buy one get one free in the form of a credit every month for one of the phones with no money down because of our stellar credit rating. So later that night my wife and I are looking over the papers and discover he ordered the s10 e which our the lowest quality s10 not what we wanted he never explained there were three options and took it upon himself when we clearly said s10. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-6459613-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-6459613\"><p>Next day I call and they say no problem when UPS delivers just refuse delivery and they will send out correct phones. I call back and order the correct s10 and s10 plus now they tell me since we sent the others back I'm required to pay a deposit why am I being punished because your sales rep ordered the wrong phones. three days go by and they call three different days with different down payments 149.00 then it was 500.00 then it went to 700.00. Know im getting mad I call and he agreed on 49.00 per phone but I had to take two s10 I told him the s10 is to small for my big hands and I want the s10 plus well that's a 249.00 deposit I'm being forced pretty much to take the smaller phone. </p><p>So they arrive and sure enough it's too small for me. I call them and at this time I discover that they are not T-Mobile but a third party dealer and also I have no insurance on my phones but the sales rep sold to me so I have 2000.00 dollars in phones and no insurance at this point I'm livid and there's nothing he can do I can only return once I'm stuck. Oh and also I can't have the same plan because it's no longer available. It changed that morning but I signed up a week ago. Oh well nothing they can do. So now my bill is 60.00 dollars more then what it was with Sprint. </p><p>I decide to call T-Mobile directly now that I know they are not who they claim to be. I get a manager on the Phone by the name of Edward and he's so apologetic and they have nothing but problems with these third party dealers. He looks over the account and says, \"Oh my. You had thirty two calls in three days. What can I do tho make it right.\" In the end he credited all my money back with totaled 359.00 but it was credited to the account I was ok with that he told me to go to an actual store return the phone and get the one I want I did all was good in my world for 4 days. </p><p>Then I get a text message from T-Mobile because I did a buyer's remorse which is what the manager told me to do I no longer qualify for the buy one get one they will no longer be giving me the credit for the phone screwed again. I get on the phone with another manager they can no longer give me the plane because it's not available but it was when I signed onto your service. They rescinded the credits the other manager gave me so I say enough I want to cancel and send your phones back. </p><p>They say you can cancel but you're responsible for payment of the phones which total about 1900.00. I only had fourteen days and today is 15. Funny how the text message came on the day after. I plead my case how they are very dishonest and after going back and forth for an hour she is going to send me some kind of credit card for 450.00 and along with the 350.00 the first manager gave me to cover everything they charged me already I can apply towards the cost of the phone which in theory gives me a free phone. Fine but what about the 350.00 you already got out of me that the manager gave me credit for you our now taking from me to pay for the phone. They screwed me hard stay away from T-Mobile my bill is now after everything still 30 dollars more than Sprint was and can't cancel or I have to pay them for the phones.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-6459613\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-6459613\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-6459613-btn\">\n",

But I guess I put the SIM card in wrong cuz it got stuck inside without the tray! So I went to my local T-Mobile store to see if they could help! But wrong the girl seemed to made it worst! So then, they recommended me to another place like a repair shop but they couldn’t! As their tweezers were far too big to fix it! So afterwards, they send me back to T-Mobile, yippie (sarcasm) &amp; they had us try another repair store and we did and even one more but all couldn’t! Either they didn’t have the right tools, or they just didn’t wanna tear it apart! </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-6421138-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-6421138\">\n",

First example is when I signed on. They told me I got \"Netflix on us\" but after signing up a couple days later I inquired how to take advantage of that. I was then told I did not have \"Netflix on us\". The next situation was when I asked about \"Binge On\". They told me I had \"Binge On\" even though I have unlimited data. I wanted binge on so that I would not use my high speed data. Even though I have unlimited I still only have 50ish GB of high speed data. They told me I had \"binge on\" and I had no need to worry. A couple months later I asked if Hulu was included in my Binge On and I was informed I don't have \"binge on\" and they can't do anything about it. So I have come to the conclusion they will mostly tell me what I want to make me happy. They are liars and not practicing a good business.</p></div>, <div class=\"rvw-bd\"><span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">Original review: July 24, 2019</span><p></p><p>Beyond appalled by T-Mobile's horrid customer service. I paid $15 a month for top insurance they offer on iPhone 7+ for almost 2 years. On the 21st month, my disabled mother drops her phone and cracks screen. T-Mobile was unhelpful and uncooperative trying to charge me $300 to replace the phone with the $15 a month insurance. Don't believe their scam they cover the dropping it because the simple answer is THEY DON'T. Buy Apple Care and be done with it. So, I dropped the coverage, and said took the bail. Bought an iPhone XS Max and this time purchased the Apple care. Intent was to give my 85 year old grandma the iPhone 10 and then pass down to my disabled mom the iPhone 7 that my grandma is using that I gave her a while back.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-6411688-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-6411688\"><p>I told her to go to T-Mobile they should be able to help her out it's me and my mom and I spend $200+ a month with T-Mobile. MY 85 YEAR OLD GRANDMOTHER HAD TO GO TO THIS STORE 4 TIMES AND THEY STILL WOULDN'T HELP HER. 1st time. They said they can't help phone is not in her name is nothing they can do. I call TMobile they get her added on account. I told her tell them to call me if there is a problem so 2nd time they say the phone is locked there is nothing they can do goodbye.</p><p>I call TMobile they say how embarrassed they are an apologize tell me the phone should be unlocked she can take it back up there. She goes up there and again they turn her away no one again contacts me no one is interested in helping her since they can't make money off her in the store. I call T-Mobile again same song and dance how sorry they are they are treating my 85 year old grandmother this way and this time send me an email authorization saying the phone unlocked. Follow these steps. She goes back up there trying to get help a 4th and last time before giving up. They said phone needs to be connected to iTunes they can't and won't help her.</p><p>As a previous Apple Engineer for iPhone these are some of the most unintelligent and cruel individuals in their handling of helping an 85 year old grandmother and my disabled mother. I would not EVER recommend this store. AVOID THIS STORE AT ALL COST, IN FACT, AVOID T-MOBILE!!! ! Don't condone this nasty behavior and let them know that the grandparents and disabled people deserved to be help even if not being squeezed for extra cash by all means their son/grandson is fitting the bill for two families and just bought the iPhone XS Max from that store a month ago. Follow up: I did follow up with T-Mobile I reached out to the CEO directly after not getting adequate feedback from the support that replied here.</p><p>Their response was unsympathetic at best doing their clever best to shift blame and quote policy. While I did entirely expect this I thought as their CEO touts a customer centric experience I would not get the typical well technically it’s not our policy to not help non customers. Mind you my disabled mother is actually a customer just so happens I pay for her like. Regardless, the end result was that they took advantage of my complaint to actually try and UPSALE me. Sorry we treated your parents horribly and ultimately led to them trying to do things on their own which broke the sim on phone but we would love to sell you a new device. Not that the XS Max wasn’t enough then they said they don’t make any money off selling phones...</p><p>I lost all respect for this company and my cancellation is for Aug 14 for all extra lines but me and my mother. Those two lines I will be taken to ATT. Sorry John ** at T-Mobile your customer practices are terrible. 1 star. And worst yet over the past year the 4G LTE has went from an average 25mpbs to 3-5mpbs and that is without being anywhere near a large data user!!!! My mother has yet to still get phone after bought iPhone X and iPhone XS Max from Tmobile because I’d their refusal to make it right. Looking forward to starting fresh with ATT.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-6411688\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-6411688\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-6411688-btn\">\n",

Recently I started having problems with the charging port like there was a short in it. I took it to the T-Mobile store and they looked in the charging port and said their phones were prone to corrosion damage from the high humidity, thus any warranties are voided because that's considered water damage, thus any warranties are voided and offered to sell me another phone. I've been with T-Mobile for 19 years and all of my phones lasted for years, and I never had a corrosion problem to a charging port. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-6378718-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-6378718\"><p>If these phones are so sensitive to humidity then why don't they put a cover over the port when it's not being charged? Needless to say I did not get another T-Mobile phone since evidently their newer phones are designed to fail in only a year's time. Evidently they're not making them like they used to!

To current customers and non-customers please take note as T-Mobile is where you want to stay or be in the years to come. They have amazing things coming around the corner and you will want to be a part of it. I know this because they listen to their customers and respond appropriately exceeding my expectations. My experience the last six years from both a personal and business account perspective has been most incredible, most uplifting, and most desirable a consumer could experience. When I switched carriers from Verizon to T-Mobile I was looking for an economical and quality carrier. I not only found that, but much more that exceeded any customer experience in my many decades on planet earth.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-6368734-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-6368734\"><p>I have had some great company experiences in my lifetime and personally I have delivered top-notch Customer Service and Technical Support as well. In Aerospace I received letters of accommodation and recommendation from Japan Airlines and the Boeing Company including a Memorial from JAL. I know customer service and technical support. T-Mobile, hands down the number one company experience in my lifetime. It started six years ago when I was located in an area that had no service by any carrier. T-Mobile found a way to get me at least 2G to my phone. I did not know 2G still existed. No carrier could penetrate this structure, but T-Mobile did. They used engineering and finagled phones until they found the right combination. They never gave up to fulfill my service in a desperate situation. Two years later I switched over to a business account.</p><p>Again, out of nowhere they made my experience 100% better by assigning me a team! A team of people available to me 24/7 all seven days a week. This team knows me better than any company has in the past. They are at the meat of my business keeping my operation alive and well. T-Mobile has never wavered. I believe in their customer centric mentality throughout the company. They look at your circumstances and make decisions based on your needs and situation before their own. Their genuine concern and expertise in resolving technical issues is exemplary and unparalleled in the cell phone industry. They have helped me immensely in overcoming a changing economic landscape and every day challenges life can throw at you like theft and technical issues.</p><p>At the end of the day their actions are what separates them from any other organization. T-Mobile is behind me, in front of me, and they will be, by my side as long as I buy cell phones. One of the most impressive moments recently was when they got LG on the phone with me. The actual manufacturer. I needed backup completed beyond three phones, to help me with recovery. That was a first as they wanted me to be assured they have no limits to deliver exactly what you ask for. I want to acknowledge my team at T-Mobile with this endorsement. Thank you very much Team!</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-6368734\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-6368734\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-6368734-btn\">\n",

Upon arriving at the store with my husband and two of my sons, I found the salesman that I had originally spoken with and we went over all the deals again. I had two iPhones 8 Plus that I still owed part of it to AT&amp;T, one iPhone 5c that was just being transferred, and I needed a new phone to replace a broken one. The deal offered was the same he had originally given me. The two AT&amp;T phones would fall under the buy back and part would go for an upfront credit that would be enough to cover the taxes for the new phones and the accessories and the rest would be sent to me in a cash card for the replacement of the broken one I was told that since I was bringing in a new line and there was no buyback I would get the new iPhone XR free offer.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-6358066-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-6358066\"><p>It took us about five hours to do all the switching and when we left everything seemed fine. The next evening I downloaded the T-Mobile app and when I checked for my purchases things did not seemed right and one of the buy back credits was no longer there. I called the store and was told not to trust the app because things are never listed right in the beginning. I had red flags going up and requested that they hold on to the phones that I had. Turned it in just in case but they told me that the phones were gone and that I had no right to them. I returned to the store after work and questioned the salesman what was going on. He told me that after I called they checked into it and found out that the offer he had given me had expired and T-mobile had switched my contract to the new one.</p><p>In the new contract my free phone was no longer free and one of the phones that was part of the buyback was changed to the free one and I was no longer getting the money to pay AT&amp;T. As a result the bill had gone up and the accessories that were originally covered by the buyback was now in installment plan. All the salesman could tell me was that I could lower my plan to a basic one and not trade in the third phone that I did not have it with me on the original day. That was unacceptable since that was not the plan that I signed up for. I contacted the main customer service who originally could not make heads or tails of what account because nothing matched (what a surprise) then after sending my issue to two other people, waiting for days for a response and having panic attacks over all of this, I finally received a phone call and was told that there was nothing they could do because the deal I was sold did not exist.</p><p>I requested that they cancel all my contract, take everything back without fees and either give me my phones back or give me what I owe AT&amp;T for it. I was told that I could cancel the contract because it was still under 14 days but that I would have to pay $75 return fee for each of the three phones and that I would receive anything for the phones I traded in because they were no longer my phones. After telling me that that was not acceptable they told me that they would see what they could do because they did not want to lose me as a customer, but now I’m getting the silent treatment even after an attorney that I contacted gave me the VP of customer service number and I left a message. My 14 days will be up in two days and I have a feeling that they are waiting for that so they can claim that the 14 days have passed.</p><p>I have been with AT&amp;T for almost 20 years and was NEVER treated this way. My only reason for leaving them was to lower my bill so I could pay a hospital bill. Now instead of owing about $1100 in phones and paying $320 monthly, I have all that plus $1500 in T-Mobile phones, and a monthly bill that is the same as AT&amp;T! I may have gotten screwed by T-Mobile, but at least by posting this I hope to prevent anyone else from making the mistake of going to T-Mobile! And by the way, the “free phone” is not free. After paying the taxes up front, they charge your account about $32 monthly and only credit you $22! On a 24 month plan you are still paying $240.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-6358066\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-6358066\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-6358066-btn\">\n",

I think T-Mobile's phones are simply market ripoffs. I had insurance and it did nothing for me. All they provide are more refurbished phones with the same problem as the new ones. I had to cancel the service after just 3 weeks of sheer torture trying to get someone to help me. Literary 6 hours on the phone, and nothing. Even months later, I am still being billed for the refurbished phone that didn't work. Whatever you do, stay away from this company and NEVER give them any personal information. They use the same servers as Experian. In the aftermath of my T-Mobile adventure, I went for an unlocked phone and that's working for me.</p></div>, <div class=\"rvw-bd\"><span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">Original review: July 10, 2019</span><p>I just wanted to let you know that I was I trying to switch from ATT to T-Mobile and asked about a buy one get one iPhone XR at your Saint Johns FL store 269D</p><p>What a disaster! 1. We have 5S models so I told them 3 times no trade-ins and they replied the current promotion was for a new line and bring your #s with no trade-in required – we had that covered. I was alone and looking on Wed 5 June 2019 as my wife hates the process and was at work. 2. We both came to the store the next day, 6 June 2019, to buy 1 get 1 free on the unlimited 55 plan. Confirmed again about the offer and no problem. Phones bought, accessories, phone #s switched, Visa charged, then as we were almost done the rep said: “Oh, looks like I messed up and trade--ins are required.” (6 and up). </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-6277588-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-6277588\"><p>3.

I plan on telling everyone I know about my wonderful T-Mobile experience and beware of what you are told! 5. Just wanted you to know about the local store performance.

On June 4th, I called to add data to my plan, as I had to return my former company issued phone on June 7th. I was told that the only way to add data to my plan was to switch to a different one that costs $40/month. I went ahead with these changes because I needed data for transportation apps.

I was told that because I activated the card on May 25th, changing on June 4th to a plan with data did not mean I received a full month of service (in my mind July 4th). I questioned why the prorated amount was $40 since I did not receive a full month of service but was given the runaround and no clear answers. After questioning this and asking to cancel, I was offered a CREDIT of $10! Not even worth my time to make this extremely ridiculous phone call.

They sold me an unusable product, gave me the runaround for 32 days, and finally told me that they would not refund my money (after previously agreeing to it). 2 stores, 5 phone reps, and 8 web CSR – a total of 90 miles of driving and about 30 hours of my life that I could not get back, was spent on an attempt to figured out WHY this item wouldn’t work, and if it was no other way to salvage it. Nobody in the stores knew why it wouldn’t work, I called and was transferred to FIVE different person (the first three said they didn’t handle it and didn’t know why they were transferred the call) and the floor supervisor who was the 5th person decided to hang up on me after she said she was working on my request. Finally web CSR #5 figured out what the issue was and web CSR #6 said she was getting me a refund, but it took 7-10 business days to process. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-6180133-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-6180133\"><p>I replied and asked if I was all set regarding the refund or if there’s anything I need to do, eighteen minutes later web CSR #7 said that “it’s processing right now so there’s nothing you would have to do on your end-..” On the 16th business day after that conversation, nothing went back to my account, so I contacted them again. Web CSR #8 said that she wasn’t seeing any record of it even though they had submitted it. She said she resubmitted it and that it took fifteen business days to process. Yesterday, which marked a week after that last communication, she messaged me and said that the refund did not get approved. If this was exhausting for you to read, imagine actually going through it.</p><p>The product was a 21-day tourist plan SIM card. It’s a temporary phone number under a service plan that is only good for 21 days effective the date it’s activated. Our first attempt to activate it was less than 10 days after the item arrived. There really was nowhere on the product information that said there’s an X amount of time that number/SIM card must be activated upon purchase. When the item arrived I didn’t even open the packaging until the time it was activated. On the back side of the SIM card package there was an instruction of how to use it: Get the SIM card out of the package, put it in your phone, dial a number to activate it, and you’re all set to use it. Simple enough, supposedly. Yet, it didn’t happen. Would not activate. </p><p>We thought it might be the phones, or maybe we did something wrong, so we decided to go to the store the next day. Next day at the store, spent about 3 hours there, the associates couldn’t figure out why it wouldn’t activate. They sent us home with an advice to try activating it again in 24 hours. The next day we decided to drive about 80 miles to a more touristy town, figured they might have a bit more experience dealing with this type of product. Brought four unlocked phones with us, overseas iPhone, overseas Android phone, local iPhone, local Android phone. We thought if the issues were the phone, one of these sure would have worked. At that store, the associate pretty much determined it was not a phone issue, it was the number. Still, he could not figure out why it would not activate. Again, we were sent home with basically an apology and he didn’t know why, and maybe try again in 24 hours.</p><p>That afternoon around 4pm I called the number on the Packing Slip, to acquire a Return Authorization Number (as instructed on the sheet) and figured we gave up on it. We were going to return it, and go somewhere else to buy a prepaid card. It’s a tourist plan for my brother during his 3-week visit, and we were already in day three of not having a working phone number. I won’t repeat my experience with the phone CSR (I explained above), but it was 80 minutes of a complete waste of my time, only to get hung up in the end by a supervisor. I contacted them on the web, with the original intention of returning the product, but these people were so great and so professional, they gave me a glimpse of hope that maybe, just maybe, we can get this SIM card to work, so I didn’t have to go to the store to buy another thing. </p><p>The Messenger messages went back and forth, with the shift change it got carried on to the next day. Finally, the next day at 8:11am someone figured out the root of the problem. I was told that this was activated as a tourist plan and it wasn’t working because it’s no longer active. Ding ding ding!!! So that would be why. So why would T-Mobile sent me an inactive number, that was already activated- activated by who?? Surely wasn’t me, which was the very reason I contacted them at the first place, because we could not activate it. </p><p>We opened the packaging (broke the plastic seal that wrapped the SIM card packaging), took the brand new SIM card (or we thought so- it looked so), and put it in the phone. Did not work. Could not use it. And of course they subtly hinting that this was purchased a long time ago, that this type of product was supposed to be activated right away, blah blah blah. There were no such things mentioned anywhere in the product information that the sealed SIM card must be activated immediately upon leaving their warehouse. Expecting a relative visit from overseas, I know dates and time, and things were planned accordingly- including the timing of purchase and activation of this temporary phone number.</p><p>Long story short, approx. 2.5 hours later, they said, “We will be refunding your $32.20, but where your services do not work, and we cannot activate the SIM, it will be like this plan didn’t happen.” So I went to Best Buy and bought another prepaid SIM card. It worked great. And here we are, a month later (21 business days), I received a message from a T-Mobile web CSR, “…at this current time, the refund did not get approved as we had hoped.” </p><p>You can keep the $32.20, T-Mobile. I got the experience. I learned the lesson, and I am sharing it. Do note that I have the backup for everything that I said. And while all the written response was friendly, long, professional, and scripted, it didn’t change the fact that you shamelessly took $32.20 out of your customer’s pocket and sent them an unusable product. Congratulation on doing the right thing, not. I will never, ever, again, considering T-Mobile for any of my cellular/wireless needs. Or for any needs, for that matter. There are way too many choices out there. And if you hang around this long to read my post, reviews matter. I repeat, there are other options out there.

I use it infrequently for my side business, but it needs to be reliable. Unfortunately, the payment model is a little shady and they deactivate your account WITH NO WARNING and no feedback until it's too late, so you need to be vigilant about checking your account status.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-6158485-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-6158485\"><p>The $3/month claim is kind of shady. You have to pay a minimum of $10 at a time, and if there is not at least $3 in your account when the month rolls over, your account is quietly deactivated. So you're never really able to use the full value that you put in, which is frustrating, even though it's a small amount. On top of having your service go dark out of nowhere, they charge another buck to turn it back on. I'm sure this adds up for T-Mobile or they wouldn't do it.</p><p>Somehow I got charged for extra texts within the first 3 month period, despite not having gone over my minutes or texts. I counted them like a crazy person, and complained to customer service until they appeased me in some way I don't remember.

Now told that I had to submit my final bill, which I did but they have no record of, and that they never had a promotion like that. They now say I’m outside the 30 days to submit for the promotion.

I usually find it within 2-3 weeks and when I didn't I called to have them temporarily cancel my service until I found my phone. They told me they would and I would no longer receive any bills. Since I am partially blind I was trying to buy a new phone in a bright color so if it would get misplaced I would be able to see it, unlike the current one that is missing.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-6140068-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-6140068\"><p>I am a Senior and disabled so I could not afford to pay full price for one. I did find a phone but when I took it to the store to activate it I was told it would not work with their system. I tried several times with different phones and the last one was almost 100% sure it would work. When I called T-Mobile they told me I would need a SIM card and would send me one free since I had been a customer for so many years. I never did receive it and called them and was told to buy one at the store and they would give me a $25 credit. I expected my service would at that time be resumed and this would go toward my first month bill. Well this phone also did not work.</p><p>After so many months of being without one someone suggested that I contact T-Mobile since they were losing money as I did not have the service and ask them to provide a phone for me. I contacted them yesterday and it seemed the whole deal they made with me was nothing but a lie. I was told that they were billing me every month but then crediting my account. This money that I paid out of pocket was used to credit my account back in Feb and that I would not receive it. This was not what I agreed on nor was it what their representative told me. Another lie!!!</p><p>This makes no sense to me. Right here you can tell that they owe me. They agreed to send me a free SIM card which they would not charge me for so why are they flipping this around on me? Now I find that they put a charge of $8.68 on my credit card that I never agreed upon. A lesson learned. Never be faithful to any business as they are only interested in you to obtain your money and will lie and cheat just to keep you hanging on and using their product.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-6140068\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-6140068\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-6140068-btn\">\n",

I picked the monthly plans which was \"unltd\" data. Cost was $55 because I'm considered senior. I was very ill informed about additional charges which appeared on my online bill like how it went from $55 before tax to $70. They put add on calls to Canada and and Mexico which I didn't need and that was removed. And I know I have to pay taxes but to inflate to $70 a month so I added auto pay but that wasn't a huge help at all. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-6060493-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-6060493\"><p>But the real problem started when I lost my phone. Had insurance so I temporarily halted service so whoever finds phone wont be able to use it. Got replacement week or so later. I thought it would be a new phone but it was a crappy scratched refurbished phone. I really didn't notice how scratched up it was until a few weeks or so later when I couldn't make or receive calls. I found out I had 14 days to return it. Now it's too late to return it. The sim card I received was not turned on properly by tech support. They had turned the lost sim card back on. I figured this out when I called customer service and tech support wanted me to read off sim card number. It was a stressful call because they kept saying they show it working. I'm talking to tech support in another country. I finally got them to read back the sim card info and it did not match what I had. I was without a phone for 30 days. </p><p>When I wanted them to take off the charge for the month of no service because they turned on the wrong sim card they refused and refused to let me talk to any supervisor. This went on and on until I was able to get a phone number to the stateside office online and not thru these people in this outsourced office. I wanted to just cancel the plan and return the phone. I was told it would cost $400 to cancel. This was very strong-armed tactic and I hung up and called back to speak with a supervisor. Again no one would let me talk to one. </p><p>I called at an earlier time and managed to talk to a rep who said I would only have to pay $120 if I elect to keep phone or return it and owe nothing. When I asked the rep to send me what she just told me in writing she just said it's recorded and T-Mobile has this type of record but I wanted proof of my conversation and this result but said wasn't necessary to send me a letter. I had no choice but to agree since I'm thinking I finally was able to cancel and walk away since I didn't want to keep the phone because it was still defective. </p><p>I returned it to a T-Mobile store where I live. Nothing was said about owing a balance since I cancelled plan and paid any balance from the actual plan. Within 2 weeks I received a bill from T-Mobile saying I owe $100 for cancelled lease and that was the buyout fee. Here we go again. I called and mentioned I straightened all that out previously but they told me whoever told me I wouldn't owe anything was wrong. They refused to even give me the benefit of doubt. I wouldn't make this up because I don't want a bad mark on my credit. Then they sent it directly to collections. I paid $50 because I really can’t afford ridiculous charges at the drop of a hat and hoped to work it out but I got nowhere in talking to anyone. I didn't opt out of any arbitration and when I saw that I supposedly did I said something to salesman and he said that's for new customers and didn't apply to me. </p><p>I'm very disappointed that a company like this resorts to holding a person to a what I think is one sided agreement and to constantly give me conflicted info. I paid everything I believe I owed but they want more and almost got me to suffer thru a 2 yr lease. It was a monthly plan that they say I could be free to cancel any time but that was far from the truth. Why does 1 rep say 1 thing, another rep say another and in the end it's all in conflict. This is wrong and now it's on my credit as a bad debt for the $50. Thanks T-Mobile and I will never trust your company because of the many lies that was told to me. You can type reports to fit what you claim to tell me but in the end you shook me down to get another $100 away from me who is on a fixed income. Do research diligently before you agree to any cell phone plan AND company.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-6060493\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-6060493\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-6060493-btn\">\n",

The store promised $150 trade-in from old phone which they have accepted in good condition. But I only got $5 so far. What a liar! I have contacted the store 5 times, call center 4 times. They told me will fix it in another 3 weeks. I am so disappointed. When I puchased S10, salesman tricked me. Purchased unwanted items with the phone and told me they are free.

I go into the store in Gallatin, TN which no one knew what they were doing. I was told it would be no problem, no fees and no hassle. Well, I should have walked away. They hooked up one line with the others to be hooked up in two days. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-5589475-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-5589475\"><p>We went back in two days later and they wanted us to pay $400+.

Robert (manager) told my husband to go to Sprint as soon as possible switch back to them and call him so, he could close the account. Which we went to Sprint and my husband called Robert back and he wasn’t there. The manager at Sprint had told us they should have given the phone back to me. We had to wait until Monday. We call Robert on Monday and he tells my husband that he would have to call customer service to close account. Another lie! </p><p>We called corporate to see if we could get my phone back and close the account. They wouldn’t return my phone and had a hard time trying to close the account. They kept trying to get us to say with them. Why would we do that we don’t have any of their phones and honestly the whole experience was horrible! I wasted over two days of my time dealing with all of this. We also, will have a bill from T-Mobile and Robert says he would take care of it when it comes in. We will see if that’s a lie too!

Shame on you guys, a loyal 15 year customer has lost all trust in you, your ethic and professionalism.

I kept T-Mobile until I could establish phone service in Ecuador. When I visited the States last October, I called T-Mobile customer service to cancel my service. My daughters were on my account, so I gave permission to transfer their lines to them and gave permission for them to make changes (set up their own accounts with their existing phone numbers). I was told that because the billing cycle did not end until November the cancellation would not go into effect until then. The account was never cancelled by T-Mobile and T-Mobile continued to bill my credit card. My credit card was billed in December for the November bill. However, when T-Mobile continued to bill my card in January and February, I made a call from Ecuador at my expense and was on the phone for quite a long time talking to customer service, who assured me the account would be cancelled and even reimbursed me for the January billing. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-5343187-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-5343187\"><p>Upon arrival in the US for another visit, I had mail waiting for me stating my phone service had been terminated for lack of payment and that I had a total balance of $380.76 and threatening to turn me over to a credit collections agency.

When I complained to her about this, she got even more talkative and very defensive. I did not call her to be her friend, I just wanted my problem solved.

The replacement phone was sent out to my PO Box, which I was told that T-Mobile never sends phones through USPS. About a 10 day later I contacted customer service to get an update on the location of the phone and 2 different times I was told \"we do not know where the phone is.\" They sent another phone out and 14 days after the replacement phone was ordered I received 2 new phones, in which I sent one back. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-5205730-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-5205730\"><p>Long story short 26 days after the initial order I made the switch and was then told it would take 24 hours for my phone service would not be available for an additional 24 hours. My phones came on last night and that opened another mess. I was told that I would have excellent 4G service and internet. I have NO SERVICE and NO INTERNET! I had contacted customer service on April 5 and requested to cancel my service and was told multiple times that I could not return 2 of the phone because I had passed my 20 day buyer remorse. I could not get them to understand they have not fulfilled their promises and that I didn't even take the phone out of the boxes because I hadn't received the last phone. How could I be expected to know whether I liked the new phones if I couldn't use them.</p><p>I was hoping that T-Mobile would be the answer to high cell phone bills but and you can see it has been a nightmare. I WOULD NOT recommend T-Mobile to anyone after this fiasco. On a side note I have in the last 2 days been talking to LaTonya from T-Mobile and she is working real hard to resolve these issues. She has been an excellent source of help. My only advise for her is that she should find a better company to work at.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-5205730\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-5205730\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-5205730-btn\">\n",

Back in 2004-2006 they were probably the best wireless company in terms of customer service, trying to get market share and brand recognition. Their signal reception and network coverage was rated as average to pretty good, up until about 2012-2014 probably. Since then, both customer service and product/wireless service have fallen off a cliff.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-5202736-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-5202736\"><p>1. Signal strength in midtown Manhattan is practically a joke. Go to cellreception.com, enter a ZIP code and you'll see the reviews. People have to go outside of buildings hoping to get 1-2 bars.</p><p>2. Getting simple, straight answers from T-Mobile is like pulling teeth. For example, if you ask customer service \"are calls to 611 and Voicemail charged?\" You'll get different answers from their representatives.</p><p>3. Customer service at certain stores is not much better. The other day I walked into the store on Third Ave and 55th Street and upon telling them about the horrendous signal and that I've had the SIM card for 12 years (indicating how long I've been a customer), they blamed my phone. Their exact wording was \"We don't support this phone(!)\" Am I supposed to educate them about wireless? It's prepaid and it's GSM phone, it's supposed to work with any prepaid GSM card.</p><p>4. Website design and engineering leaves a lot to be desired. Last month the twice requested email to reset my password never arrived, Today the \"My T-Mobile\" account page would not load. People could not log in to their accounts for hours. See attached. </p><p>Yep, \"something's definitely not right,\" T-Mobile. Perhaps some execs from parent company in Germany need to come and clean up the mess.</p></div><div class=\"rvw-bd-glry js-rvw-bd-glry\" data-target-id=\"5202736\"><div class=\"rvw-bd-glry__img\" data-ca-modal-active-pic=\"1\" data-ca-modal-collection='[{\"src\": \"https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/reviews/t-mobile_403189.JPG\", \"thumbnail\": \"https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/cache/reviews/t-mobile_403189_thumbnail.JPG\", \"name\": \"\"}, {\"title\": \"T-Mobile\"}]' data-ca-modal-type=\"gallery\" data-more-images=\"0+\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/cache/reviews/t-mobile_403189_thumbnail.JPG\"/></div></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-5202736\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-5202736\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-5202736-btn\">\n",

Did renew for a couple more months, based on the T Mobile clerk telling me they were installing updated towers, and service would be better than before in early April. What a lie. For the last two weeks, unable to make or receive a phone call, send text with picture, and had to go into the street, to try to get one bar. Cancelled and asked for money back because they could not provide service they were taking bucks for. They refused to refund anything, even though they could or would not provide even basic service. Smells like fraud. Has anyone contacted the FCC or Attorneys general for their state on potential fraud charges? Taking money for promised services or goods, and not delivering, is a crime.</p></div>, <div class=\"rvw-bd\"><span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">Original review: April 13, 2019</span><p></p><p>I initially changed to T-Mobile because of their cheap plan to travel internationally. On that note, the company did have a good package and even though I was without service for couple of days (nobody knew why?!?) the price was very good. That being said, that’s the only positive thing I have to say about this company. I switched companies in November, lead by the international package and a promotion where I would buy an iPhone and would get also the iPad. Well, not only I did not receive the iPad on time before I had to travel out of the country, I just never received it! After hours spend with T-Mobile, several complaints and a lot of headache, my package was lost by UPS. An associate then told me to cancel the delivery from UPS so they could make any necessary changes in their end. Well it turned out, they couldn’t. The iPad got returned and I ended up with no iPad. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-5167612-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-5167612\"><p>I complained several times and spoke to several people, nothing got done. No follow-up was never made and I got one incompetent associate after the other. Wait, it is not over... When back to the US (and without the iPad), I noticed I was being charged for the iPad line. I called, canceled and got a credit for the next cycle. A month later, I get the bill, the iPad is still there. I called again. 3rd month, guess what? Oh yeah, the iPad is still there... I just called this week for my 4th time to cancel the iPad I never ever received!!! I just don’t understand how a company can be so misleading and disorganized and still be in business. What upsets me most is the disrespect with my time and my money. </p><p>I really wish there was a regulator for companies like T-Mobile so situations and disrespect like this would never happen to a consumer... in the end of the day, nobody was doing me a favor, I pay for this awful service! I was not crying about an iPad, I was disappointed because I was made a promise and never got what I was promised. I will never do business with this company again, will never recommend it to my worst enemy and will ever have any good thing to say about this company. Put your money and time elsewhere, at a company that at least knows what they are doing.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-5167612\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-5167612\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-5167612-btn\">\n",

Believe the stories. If I was told that T-Mobile was actually a front for the Devil, and made most of its money dealing in human trafficking, forced child labor, and supplying illegal weapons to third world dictators, I would completely believe it. Signed up for 2-for-1 special in Fall of 2018. The Offer stated you had to turn in your old phone first. Five days in and there is a major security breach...10% of T-Mobile's customer accounts get hacked, including mine. I was forced to stay with them because my wife's old phone was now on a boat headed to Nigeria along with 5 year old American Baseball jerseys. As stated by others, their cellular coverage is terrible; bordering on comedic. But my biggest complaint is their corporate policy. I've going to itemize everything for the sake of simplicity:</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-5145112-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-5145112\">\n",

      "                            1) They routinely over-bill and try to cheat you out of money at every conceivable opportunity. They doubled the amount owed on my balance and then pretended like it never happened. They also stuck me with a Samsung phone that was incompatible with Sprint and Verizon without telling me (a tactic they use to prevent people from leaving them for another carrier). After paying off my phone I was forced to go to AT&amp;T because they were the only other network provider that was compatible with my T-Mobile Galaxy Note 9.<br/>\n",

You'll waste half an hour explaining the situation to someone and their response will always be \"I can't do anything.\" Then you have to speak to a manager and repeat the entire story again.

When you bring previous phone calls to their attention they pretend it never happened and act like you're the crazy one (I had to download a recording app for my phone just to protect myself).<br/>\n",

      "                            5) They intentionally meddle with peoples accounts. They throttle data and restrict phone access even if you're fully paid. Sometimes they do this purely out of revenge if you have the audacity to call up and complain. I've literally had managers hang up on me when they ran out of lies...then they intentionally restricted my phone service to cover their tracks and pretend that hanging up on me wasn't a deliberate act.<p>6)They will do EVERYTHING in their power to stop you from leaving. When it comes to getting the unlock codes to the phone (you know...the one you paid off) they will stall as long as possible. They even changed my private login codes to my account...then a AT&amp;T representative had to spend two hours helping me switch my number! After finally ridding myself of these demonic children I was sent a bill for $15 dollars the following month, even though they assured me my debt was fully paid. And when I mentioned how T-Mobile deliberately changed my account login information to push me into the next billing cycle they lied about that also!!! Honest to God, avoid T-Mobile like the plague.

The customer service was never great, but when I switched to Sprint to take advantage of the free year I learned what truly bad customer service looks like. I was originally told my phone was unlocked, but after porting to Sprint it turned out it wasn't. I called T-Mobile repeatedly and over the course of two days, with a non-working phone, I was given conflicting information, misinformation and in the end it will likely be a full four days until my phone is unlocked. With other carriers offering great deals, better than T-Mobile, there is no reason to settle for appalling service.

My son recently started working for Verizon and switched us all over to Verizon for the discount benefits. I really had no other reason for leaving T-Mobile except for the fact my son wanted to pay for our phone service. This was the beginning of my nightmare. We had our numbers ported over to Verizon 3 days into the new billing cycle at the end of January. I should have received a paper bill for the December to January cycle around the beginning of February. I never received my bill instead I received a past due notice near the end of February.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-5018374-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-5018374\"><p>I called requested a summary bill which I received at the beginning of March. On March 9th I received the next bill for the January to February cycle which included my past due balance for Dec – Jan cycle and a full month’s service for the Jan – Feb cycle. On March 11th I received a letter from a collection agency for the total amount due. This started the series of phone calls, lies and empty resolutions from T-Mobile. First, I was told that they read me a disclosure stating that I would still be responsible for the entire month of service.</p><p>My next phone call I was told that my account was not in collections and that they would review my account and someone would call me back in 3-5 business days. No return phone call. Next phone call I was told I had to wait for the system to recalculate my bill which would not be generated until the end of the billing cycle on March 26th. March 29th, I received another past due balance for the Jan-Feb billing cycle. I called again and they still had not prorated my bill for the 3 days of service. This time they stated they were working on it as we spoke. April 4th, received the bill that was generated from the close of the March 26th billing cycle. Called again, received the usual apologies and please hold while I open your account.</p><p>My son called and thought we had it all straightened out but that was false hope. He was disconnected during the call. We waited about an hour and then called back. This time they were going back and forth and stated that I still owed the original amount billed. They put me on hold again several times. They came back and said the original amount was a valid amount owed because I had a history of late payments and had an outstanding balance from November. This was not true, I have all my receipts and if my payments were late, I always paid any late charges associated with my bill.</p><p>I handed the call over to my son who took over the call and then they told him that line about the disclosure and having to pay the entire month of service. I am thankful to my son who has been a T-Mobile Sales Rep and now a Verizon Sales Rep and knew the policies. He worked with T-Mobile and got the account prorated and I ended up being billed only for the 3 days of service that I owed. Before this whole experience I would have considered returning to T-Mobile someday but now I will never return to T-Mobile.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-5018374\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-5018374\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-5018374-btn\">\n",

That’s what typically being offered whenever you report weak reception at home, which is quite common to T-Mobile. Rather than invest into better network coverage they do it like that. I haven’t done any studies to see how many other people affected with the similar story, but I am sure I am not alone with this. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-4955566-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-4955566\"><p>I’ve been T-Mobile customer twice and both times was stupid enough to get engaged with their offering of ‘signal boost’ devices. First time it was actual router they gave me and when I decided to part ways with them they wanted to router back obviously. They’ve sent me a return kit and I happily sent the router back. Few week later invoices started to come with router value showing as outstanding. I do not exactly remember how I got this fixed first time. Certainly couple phone calls and emotional talks with T-Mobile reps and finally they acknowledged that I’ve returned the device and I don’t owe nothing. This experience was already indicative and I made myself a note to be more careful next time (i.e. keep records of me returning device and all associated emails). Well, that didn’t help.</p><p>Here is the second story. Once again I stupidly decided to engage with T-Mobile and of course since nothing changed with their cell signal quality, they offer another ‘signal boost’ device. This time it was so called “4G Cell Spot”. Fast forward about 9 month from that, I decided to change carrier. Same story repeated. They wanted their CellSpot back obviously and I was ready for potential issues but apparently not well enough. On July 9th 2018 they sent me two emails. One to inform about “CellSpot cancellation and the need to return it within 30 days” and second one about the return kit that was sent my way to return it. I have waited for the return kit for couple weeks and begin worried about the 30 days deadline, I have called T-Mobile myself. They basically gave me the way to issue another return label so that I could send the CellSpot without waiting on return kit.</p><p>On July 24 2018 I went to UPS store and dropped off the CellSpot and made picture of that with tracking number of the box. On July 26th 2018 I received an email from T-Mobile that CellSpot was received. I have relaxed at that point, but I shouldn’t. Couple weeks later the return kit arrived, which I discarded of course, since I already sent the device out. Few more weeks later invoices with outstanding CellSpot value started to come in. Painful journey has started and after hours of phone calls, 3 visits to stores, assurances that investigation is closed and confirmation numbers given out to support that, I ended up with collection agency and 1 derogatory account that is now spoiling my excellent credit history. If you don’t want to run into a chance, just stay away.</p><p>Needless to say that after collection agency took away the deal, T-Mobile, washed their hands despite the fact that I’ve had all the evidence to prove that I don’t owe nothing. They obviously lost the device within their own premises but chosen to blame the customer instead of fixing their processes. By thy way, attempt to fix this with collection agency itself has failed as well. Those guys don’t even know what they are collecting money for, they just want the money.

Scammer- a person who commits fraud or participates in a dishonest scheme. I went to T-Mobile in Merrillville, IN at the beginning of the month. I put 600 down on an iPhone XR. I was told by the scammer Mike that my monthly bill was going to be 77$. However when I saw my first bill it was 97 and some change. I set up an arrangement for April 4th to get a little more time to see why the hell my bill was 97$. They sent a confirmation of the arrangement and still charged me the 97$ when I made the arrangement. So now I'm fighting with my bank to get my money back. T-Mobile denied my refund amount and are not trying to resolve the matter. I'm calling corporate, because somebody's gonna give me my damn money back!

As for their customer service, well that's an entirely different matter. T-Mobile customer service is the second worst customer service in the industry. The worst customer service is A-t--e but T-Mobile is a close second. They Lie and deceive their customers and do not take responsibility or ownership in anything where they dropped the ball or LIED to their customers. They run promotions and giveaways to entice new and current customers into their stores only for them to find out they were LIED to and deceived.

They promised to buy my phones, and promised to buy out Verizon, and pay me to switch. Their service was terrible. The phones did not work in most areas around southeast Ohio and my son took his phone across the country to California and had poor to no service most of the time. They stole our Verizon phones and never paid me. They did not pay us to switch. When we left and went back to Verizon, they made up charges; like stating that I did not return their phone, even though I have tracking information to prove that I did return it. They have harassed me for over a year and even turned me in to collections, which I then had to prove that I did nothing wrong to fix my credit. T-Mobile is a terrible company. Don't trust anything they promise to you.</p></div>, <div class=\"rvw-bd\"><span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">Original review: March 12, 2019</span><p></p><p>If I could give 0 stars I would.

If anything this is a deeper issue with a company that won't expand coverage or have a reasonable solution to having customers in remote areas. It doesn't help that on top of paying out the lease on my phone (to unlock it) there is another $160+ fee. I will never be doing business with T-Mobile again, I suppose one positive to take away from this is don't lease your phones and don't do business with T-Mobile.

Nine days ago, I requested to unlock my phone because I will be traveling and I need a phone that works with any provider. I made my request on March 1, of course I paid all my equipment and accessory balances first. The agent who attended my request told me to wait from 24 to 72 hours to receive an e-mail informing me about the next steps. After waiting for the 72 hours, in fact, more than 72 hours, on day five I called again. The agent said that he will take care of my ASAP request. He tried to find out if my request was done. Then he said, \"I am sending you a text with the instructions to unlock, but wait until you get the e-mail from Apple stating that the device is unlocked.\" I wait two to three more days. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-4804594-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-4804594\"><p>Here I am calling again on day 9, and the guy who attended my call assured that the unlock was done.

My phone was not unlocked. Here I am again calling T-Mobile experts. This guy said he had to resubmit my unlock request to Apple, and sent the request confirmation e-mail. This email was the first e-mail I received in all these days (except for those of password change). I feel so disappointed, for were previous agents fooling me? What was the purpose of that?

After trying various troubleshooting updates, backups, reboots, the problem still existed. The representative stated that it sounded like a software issue and that since she felt that people are not told about the importance of extending warranties she would add on the extended warranty for $13 and initiate the process.

I waited for an email and checked on Monday Feb 25th and never received an email from Support. I checked again on Tuesday Feb 26th and saw that my account had been charged $443 for out of warranty phone.</p><p>I then contacted T-Mobile customer service, once again after work at 10:30 pm and of course got someone out of country again. After explaining everything to him he referred me to a supervisor. The supposed supervisor stated that the phone we returned had been determined damaged, but she didn't know what type of damage was determined and I would have to wait until the next day for her to find out what type of damage was accessed. </p><p>I told her that the phone was working fine - it was simply the fact that my son couldn't answer the phone utilizing the handset and only thru his Bluetooth device. I told her that I had been promised that the phone would be covered under the warranty and that is why I agreed to send it back instead of taking it in to a local T-Mobile office so as not to be hassled regarding the warranty. Nothing was ever stated that I could automatically be charged this large amount of money or I would never had sent the phone in. I would have researched another venue as I would not have agreed to this large of an amount for a refurbished phone. I am very upset about the way T-Mobile has handled this by just charging me and never disclosing anything to me about any additional charges.</p><p>On Feb 27th I contacted them once again since I still had not received a return call nor email from the first representative who started this fiasco whom I had also reached out to. I requested T-Mobile to return my son's phone and I will send the refurbished phone back to them. Then I was told that the phone was probably destroyed since it was deemed damaged yet they can't even tell me what kind of damage they are saying was determined. </p><p>When I told the gentleman that they can't simply charge me without disclosing that to me beforehand. He stated that the first representative could not have applied the warranty without having disclosed that information to me. I told him then he could go back and listen to the conversation with her and he would see that she never stated anything about any additional charges. He stated that he would get with his supervisor and that first representative and go over the recorded phone calls and get back to me. I have yet to hear from them and don't believe that I will. I do plan on taking this to the FCC and to court if need be as I believe they are simply running a scam. Since I kept the tracking information and they couldn't charge me for not having truly received my son's phone back they decided to claim that the phone was out of warranty and charge me that way instead.</p><p>There was nothing physically wrong with the phone when we sent it in - simply the issue with not being able to talk on the phone utilizing the handset only via Bluetooth which she stated she believed was a software issue.

Mostly when when you call. They make it very difficult to get things accomplished. Very Time Consuming. They tell you to go to the store to change your plan. Then the store says they can't do it. You have to call. Then when you call, they can't do it because you are 2 days into the next cycle. Then you call them back at the end of the cycle and they say they can't do it over the phone you have to go to the store because you have to pay for another SIM card that is extra 25.00 than the T-Mobile SIM card you already have.

The honest open platform that they advertise is all lies. After I switched and lost all my ATT benefits. The T-Mobile service was terrible on 2 of my phones that they said would work fine. After dealing with tech support for over a month, they finally told me the phone were not compatible with T-Mobile service. Already stuck, I decided to get 1 of the phones replaced. The sales rep on the phone said that if I traded in my phone and carried service for 2 years that the new phone would be mine free and clear. Another 2 months waiting for the monthly credits to appear to no avail. Called again and this time they told me that I was stuck in a lease and basically lost my trade in. Now stuck with sketchy service and no phone. Worst mistake I ever made.</p></div>, <div class=\"rvw-bd\"><span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">Original review: Feb. 25, 2019</span><p></p><p>Tonight, I'm trying to cancel my T-Mobile service.

Meanwhile, after selecting the option for 'Discontinuing Service', I've been on hold for 25 minutes. Not a word from a person. No indication about wait time. No option to get a call back. I'm kinda starting to think this is a deliberate tactic. Wait out the caller who wants to cancel.

They are thieves and money hungry hyenas. We've been with them 1 month and switched to another reliable and reasonable carrier. T-Mobile internet is the slowest compared to all other companies, they overcharge you for international talk/text/roaming. While abroad their service is even worse due to roaming, internet is so slow you cannot rely on it. I had to use local wifi to use internet. After we switched they also charged us additional $180 for cancelling and switching to another carrier. Fees are different than our original bill and they couldn't provide me a written policy to prove they have the right to charge me for next billing cycle even though we'd cancelled. What's even more interesting our original charge was $135 for 2 lines. On their final bill it went up to $150 plus $30 additional fees for both lines, total of $180.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-4736575-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-4736575\"><p>T-Mobile is a money hungry company which provides absolutely the worst customer service, worst phone service and slowest unreliable internet service.

For instance, I bought my iPhone outright from a T-Mobile store, yet 18 months later it took FIVE phone calls to customer service to unlock my phone. T-Mobile had misregistered my iPhone serial number as a Verizon phone. Additionally, T-Mobile made me pay a last bill, even though I had shut down service, then turn around and said I had a $69.85 credit, which I was never properly refunded. When I call their Customer Service about the missing refund, T-Mobile was going to make me call Citibank to reissue the check (if T-Mobile had been willing to give me a credit to my credit card number, WHICH T-Mobile HAD ON RECORD, a check never would have been necessary).

Same story...back office will take care of it. I wonder who works there. That back office is like Mystery Box. You never know what comes out of it. How many times can I repeat myself? I already paid for the so called services - 1 week only. I'm not going to pay for the services T-Mobile did not provide. The sales rep who sold us this crappy service did not mention anything about first &amp; full monthly payment, in case if we want to cancel. Her goal was to get the commissions. Don't go with T-Mobile. THEY PROMISE YOU THE WORLD, BUT THEY DO NOT DELIVER.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-4613293\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-4613293\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-4613293-btn\">\n",

During the switch, the store rep said T-Mobile has improved coverage and we will have no issue using our Verizon S7 phones. After switch, we spent numerous hours talking to the T-Mobile staff for various issues, different staff have different levels of training and offered different theories. Some said it's APN, some said it's sim card, some said it's signal and coverage, some said it's the phone. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-4608691-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-4608691\"><p>One time a T-Mobile staff transferred the call to a Samsung rep who stated it's not the phone issue. We were confused, exhausted, frustrated, and disappointed. How come the store did not tell us when we switch? How many calls, business, and trips we missed and affected? Our friends and families are frustrated and telling us to dump the phones and the service. The T-Mobile reps tried to convince us to purchase new phones, we felt this is another trap. We just changed the sim cards, still have hope the issue will be resolved.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-4608691\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-4608691\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-4608691-btn\">\n",

The associate at the store was transferred numerous times and put in a very difficult position. We were assured the numbers would be ported by a representative. They said it could take up to 24 hours. Fast forward to today 1/23. The numbers still have not ported over. My husband's number is still active on the prepaid account yet mine was deactivated.

I tried to send it 4 times and each time it was refused. Obviously he doesn't care anymore about his customers or customer service than anyone else at that company: \"Dear Mr. Legere, my name is Amy ** and I am at a loss as to where else to turn so I decided to go straight to the top of your company. On 5/8/18 my sister and I signed up for the T-Mobile ONE Unlimited 55 plan and purchased two LG V30 phones on a BOGO program. When we made the change we were showed a map at the store that showed coverage in the area where we lived and worked because we both travel for our jobs. We were coming from AT&amp;T and were excited because it was a much better deal than we had at AT&amp;T. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-4580176-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-4580176\"><p>At first we seemed to have some coverage in certain areas but not that great. By the time I had any jobs in other areas and found out I had no service whatsoever it was past the 14 days. I was even in Asheville, NC which is a pretty large city in NC and I had absolutely no service for talk or text for two days. I decided I had to try to do something. I called T-Mobile and talked to numerous customer service reps for over a period of 5 1/2 hours on one day. I was told they had had complaints from other customers in my area. It was decided by your reps that it would be best if we would cancel the service and be put on an EIP (equipment installation plan) and buy the phones from T-Mobile and take the unlocked devices to AT&amp;T and get the service back from them. They were aware that we were cancelling both lines and buying both phones. </p><p>I was told that the charge per month would be $54.00 which was $30.00 for both phones ($15.00 each) because they were on a BOGO plan and $12.00 per phone for insurance. A few days later I received a later saying that the insurance on the phones was cancelled which brought the monthly fee down to $30.00 which for 22 months was $660.00 but because of payments already made I was told we still owed $638.00 to pay off the phones and close our account. When I received the August bill it was for $668.17. I called and talked to a rep named Renee and I asked if I could break the amount down into a few payments without any additional charges or fees and she said I could so I made a payment of $170.00 on 8/23/18. </p><p>On 9/23/18 a collection letter was sent out that said I owed $532.17 even though I was told I could make the payments. When I called about the letter, I was told in order to break it down into payments I needed to go back to the T-Mobile store and buy a SIM card and that she would call me back after I made the purchase and get the card number in order to set it up on a payment plan. After I did all of this and talked to various reps it was determined that that was not going to work and that it had to all be paid off. So now I had to come up with the $532.17 plus I was out the money for the new SIM card. My sister and I came up with the money and I paid it in full on 10/11/18 and was told by Rey that that was all I owed. </p><p>After making this payment I thought it was over but it was far from it. The next bill I received showed that I owed $566.17 with no explanation as to why. I called and spoke to Marquita who said she had no idea what the charge was for and she said she would have her manager call me on 10/22/18. I never received any call from her manager. I have my phone with me at all times because of my job and I had no missed calls. I called again on 11/15/18 and talked to Fonz and then to Mary Jane, a supervisor and she said she would have her supervisor call me on 11/16/18. Of course that call never came either. Somehow the bill went down to $71.00 and I called to find out what it was for on 11/20/18 and talked to Jameka who said she was located in Charlotte, NC and that she would look into the problem and definitely call me on 11/30/18 so that she could make sure everything had cleared out. </p><p>So now three for three, she also never called me back.One of the problems was that we were being charged for the number associated with the SIM card that they used in an attempt to set up monthly billing which never worked. And I was also being charged for some reconnect fee when I had no service with your company. I have now received a bill that is back up to $571.10. They say this is for the other phone. When I cancelled the service in late May they knew we were cancelling the entire plan for both phones. All the reps I talked to at that time quoted me the same pay off amount of $30.00 x 22 months left to pay off. They knew it was BOGO and they told me that was all we would own. </p><p>I am sure this is not something you normally deal with but I am begging for your help in this matter. I am asking for a credit to my account for all I have been through and to have my account closed once and for all. I have been very disappointed with the lack of concern by so many of your company's representatives who have promised a callback but have never followed through on their promises. I have never had so much stress and anguish trying to get something taken care of in my life. I appreciate any assistance you can give.\"</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-4580176\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-4580176\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-4580176-btn\">\n",

I called them so they could explain to me the amount and they said they offer me a deal that they were not supposed to offer. \"Human error.\" That's what they called it! This \"human error\" was made by a manager.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-4579465-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-4579465\"><p>Be aware. Make sure that you really want to be with this company before you sign any contract. This is a bunch of irresponsible people just trying to play with other people's wallet. I broke my phone and for the first time, I called them. They were supposed to replace my phone which they did with a used, broken phone that I sent back to them... After a couple of months, they decide to charge my account $652.60 which $480.32 plus taxes was for the phone that I have returned to them already.</p><p>Date: July 16th, 2018. After many phone calls, they said they would return my money but what they did was: they kept the money and every month, until now, they are discounting my monthly bill from that amount. Besides that, after all the hours I spent on the phone talking with all different types of employees and managers, comes this manager (I am sure she was ashamed of everything that was going on with my account) and offers me a plan for the people that are over 55 years old (I am 51 and my husband 54) which would bring my bill to about $102.00 a month all inclusive (about $120.00 a month after I added a Galaxy Note 9 and I paid half of it right away).</p><p>I received a text message from T-Mobile to let me know about my next payment and today, I called them to understand why my bill is $168.59 instead of a bill of $120.00 +/- and the explanation is \"human error\"... This manager should never offer what she offered. They do whatever they want and don't honor their word. I have been with T-Mobile for many years and all of these problems just begin since I claimed a broken phone (I pay the insurance for all these years, never claimed anything) and the first time I do claim I ended up paying for the replacement glass myself because my phone is a very good phone and the replacement that was sent to me was a used phone and I couldn't work with it. That is why I send it back and guess what? All the trouble started since then. BE CAREFUL!

We were told that our phones were free and that our monthly bill would be 120 a month. Our first bill was for over 400. We called customer service and was told that the phones were not free and that this is the standard for 4 lines. I was furious. I went to the store and spoke with the sales rep that signed us up. He explained that the customer service aka headquarters does not have the same info due to their computers and headquarters do not communicate with each other. The sales guy calls them and gets our bill lowered. Ok fine. The very next month our bill is over 300. Go back to the store and once again get a runaround but the bill was lowered. Every month our statements were always high and never the same amount. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-4573144-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-4573144\"><p>After about six month's of this bs we call them to cancel the service. They told us, \"Ok you will need to pay 2500 to cancel.\" We were blown away. We did not have a contract with them. I asked what that was for and they said, \"For the 4 cell devices and the tablet.\" I said, \"We only owe for one phone.\" When we joined the deal was buy one get one free for the Samsungs. So we had done that. The other two phones were both LGs and they were free. They informed us that in fact they are only \"FREE\" after two years. So in essence that's why our bills were so high. They had been charging us for all the phones. And the tablet which they said was free.</p><p>Now fast forward our two years are up. We call to cancel the service for three phones and transfer one of the lines to another account. That took 4 days of calling because every time we called we were told it was taken care of. Everything finally got done except now I am due a refund since we canceled in the middle of the billing cycle. That was in Nov and it is now the end of Jan and still no refund. Instead they sent me to collections. I called customer service again. Now mind you since canceling with them I have had to call them now 7 times. </p><p>Here is the biggest issue. You can't go to the store to get things handled in person. Everything has to be done over the phone with people who are incompetent and barely speak English. I still do not have any resolution to this issue. I am supposed to get a confirmation call this coming Tuesday that the collection issue is resolved and my refund processed. We'll see. I'm not holding my breath. Do not join T-Mobile unless you like being lied to and given the runaround.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-4573144\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-4573144\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-4573144-btn\">\n",

The salesman, **, refers to a red hair Spanish lady who calls the manager on the phone. After the manager receives a photo of the phone he says he'll accept the trade-in. Between ** communicating with someone on his watch phone, singing, dancing and cursing we were able to purchase the phone.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-4573132-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-4573132\"><p>The store does not transfer data via cables and there was a lot of data on the phone which was not previously backed up so transferring data was impossible. ** told me that I should go home and try to backup the data on the old phone from home so that when logging into the new phone with iCloud the next day all of the apps, contacts, etc will automatically be transferred. He told us not to touch the phone today, but by tomorrow the new phone will have the transferred number and all the apps and contacts. ** also tells me about a bundle deal if I purchase the screen protector and case together. The bundle is $39.99. I initially say no but go ahead and do it anyway. We go home.</p><p>12/30/18 After being told to go home to increase the storage space so we can upload and transfer the contacts, apps and photos, which never worked... Even when they tried in store via WIFI... NO CABLES??? While in store I inform the employee, \"You NEVER put a receipt in the bag.\" He tells me he used my phone to take a picture of it... Whatever happened to a paper receipt!! In looking at my photos no receipt was there. Mysteriously he's able to print a receipt. On the bill I see he charged me $39.99 for a case and then charged me $39.99 for a screen protector but when he was selling it he said that I was getting both for $39.99 as a bundle. I also noticed a phone number on the bill that wasn't mine and never saw my number on the bill at all... He said that it was the temporary number that you get when pulling existing numbers from a carrier.</p><p>At this point the new phone still is not working with the new number. I also notice on the bill that my phone number and not my daughter's, who the purchase is for, phone number is attached to the items purchased that day... I'm not sure if that's because my phone is the main number on the account. At this point I'm truly frustrated with the service received. A phone purchase should not take multiple days.</p><p>12/31/18 After further looking at my bill I realize that ** did not take anything off the bill for accepting the phone as a trade-in and her phone number STILL has not been pulled over from the other carrier. The old phone is still running and the new phone isn't. I received a call from a T-Mobile rep regarding the number I wanted to pull over because the store rep entered in the wrong number. Within minutes the online rep got the new phone to final have the number and the phone works properly.</p><p>1/1/19 I return to the store because the receipt received does not reflect a trade-in deduction. I again approach the same salesman. I do this because I won't have to explain what happened between myself and another person so I decide to continue to work with him. I ask him to show me where on the bill does it show you accepted my trade-in. He looks at the bill and says he must have forgotten. He tells me there's nothing he can do since the transaction is already processed. He says that I need to come in the next day when a manager is on duty. </p><p>I explained to him me coming in AGAIN is extremely inconvenient. He said that since the transaction is processed only a manager has access to make adjustments and that the manager needs to see the phone in order to determine the amount that will be discounted for the trade-in which made absolutely no sense to me because the manager was not there when I made the initial purchase, so who was going to determine the trade-in amount at that time? Frustrated I decided to ask for the manager's name and number. I leave the store and decide to return the next day to speak with the manager face to face.</p><p>1/2/19 ** informed me that the manager would be in at noon. I arrive at 12:15 and was informed that the manager was in a conference call that would last about 1 hour 45 mins. The lady at the front desk tries to be helpful asking for background info thinking she may be able to help. After briefing her on the situation she relayed the info to the manager. It was decided at that time that he would make a copy of my bill in order to have my account info and the salesperson would look up the value of the phone. Once getting the value on the computer monitor she showed me and she informed me that after his call the manager would apply the credit to my bill and that I did not have to stay. Also she explained to me that when they refer to a \"bundle deal\" they are offering 2-3 items that you do not have to pay for upfront and will appear on your monthly statement to be paid in increments... Totally not the way ** presented the package.</p><p>1/3/19 In looking at my bill I do not see the credit that the store manager promised to give. I call the store because I notice that on my 12/30/18 receipt that I paid $130 did not even go to the correct phone number so someone else is now walking around with my $130 credit. I call the store manager who when the salesman picked up the phone said was available, but somewhere between finding out who was on the line became busy with a customer and would have to call me back. Let's see how long this takes. Call was placed at 12:46pm. So it's 3:10 and I still have not received a call back from the store manager. </p><p>At 2:11 I started an online chat with a T-Mobile online representative. ***Side note---both online representatives that helped me on 12/31/18 and 1/3/19 were absolutely wonderful and helped fix my problems.*** Today's representative after reviewing the credit that was erroneously applied to someone else's account advised me to return to the store and have them do a refund and then ring up my payment so it can be applied to the correct account. While she was looking at my account I asked her if she saw the credit that the store manager was to apply yesterday and of course she didn't... Even though when I called the store earlier today the manager relayed through an employee that he did. </p><p>After getting this refund I will NEVER return to this location. I will give another location a try due to the superb customer service I received online. When I arrived at the store a female employee tried to assist me and when she couldn't figure out what to do ALL of the female employees worked together to help me and for this I'm truly grateful. By the time I left the store my issue was resolved and I truly appreciate the ladies coming together to assist and they all were professional. At this point, if I have to deal with this location I'll give the ladies a chance.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-4573132\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-4573132\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-4573132-btn\">\n",

They advertise that you are getting $750 reduction in price for the new phone, but they don't tell you that part of that is the value of the phone you have to trade in. So, in my case, I ended up with a whopping $59 trade for a phone easily worth twice that. Then, they deducted the $59 from the $750 promotion rebate. And that is rebated each month, toward the financed equipment price. So, the end result is that you end up getting nothing for your trade in, and paying more than retail for the new phone. Very deceptive, and not ethical, in my opinion.</p></div>, <div class=\"rvw-bd\"><span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">Original review: Jan. 15, 2019</span><p></p><p>I had a grandfathered plan of the Simple Choice with the added 4g LTR 6 gb of data. Music streaming is supposedly free. BingeOn was enabled and according to the advertisement, explanations, and FAQ, BingeOn should not affect the 4g LTE 6gb of data and that I can tether my phone to my laptop and watch streaming qualifying streaming video without it affecting the 6gb. Great. I get a text message two weeks into the billing cycle saying that I’ve reached my limit. Wtf. So I go to check my data usage and apparently they had been deducting my from my 6gb for the “free BingeOn” video streaming and on top of that the WIFI usage. I’m using WiFi. Not the ** data. Utter bull. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-4554184-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-4554184\"><p>So I call customer service and she basically steers me to the T-Mobile ONE plan saying that I have 50gb of 4g LTE data I can use and I won’t need the BingeOn and I can watch all the video streaming blah blah blah. Great. So I switch. Also, she explained that when using the WiFi, the phone will automatically switch to data if the connection is weak, which I found out later that my phone has the function disabled so it should’ve only been using WiFi. Anyway, not only am I unable to watch any streaming while tethered to laptop now, I can’t even load ANY streaming sites on my phone and I haven’t even gotten near to using half of the 50gb. </p><p>I called customer service and they explained that ya, when you tether you get throttled to 3g service, which explains why I can’t even load the pages. I didn’t even know at the time when I spoke to CS that streaming wouldn’t load on my phone. They also tried to upsell me the ONE Plus plan for $15 more which would allow me to tether up to 10gb. Something very suspicious about that. In any case, I demanded to have my old grandfathered plan back and had them confirm that the BingeOn should not affect my data usage etc etc. It’ll take 1-2 days to go back into effect. So I’m still waiting on that. </p><p>As I’m researching the internet it turns out there are many others who switch to the ONE plan, whether it’s military or not, and are experiencing the same issue of not being able to load any streaming sites from their phone using data (WiFi it works fine). One customer said they had the ONE Plus plan and it worked fine. The streaming worked for the worker who switched their SIM card into the customer's phone. So basically, they sell you on the ONE plan saying you get 50gb of 4g LTE and you can stream movies from your phone from the streaming sites (YouTube, Hulu, Netflix) but the problem arises that you can’t even load the sites on your phone. Then they try to upsell you getting the more expensive plan so that the streaming will work. It’s a huge scam and I don’t even know if people are realizing this and it seems to be a prolific problem with this company. Something needs to be done to stop this.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-4554184\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-4554184\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-4554184-btn\">\n",

This includes HD streaming. In the description it states you can stream HD videos through your mobile Hotspot. This is a scam. After only a few days of streaming a few TV shows each night my actual data plan shot through the roof. On my T-mobile app it shows I've only used 2.2gs of my 20g mobile hotspot allowance. However in my phone's data usage log it show my hotspot has been using 30gs of mobile data. This a scam because sure they give you an allowance of 20g of mobile Hotspot they fail to mention that you'll never reach that because you'll somehow use 30gs of mobile data for every 2gs of Hotspot data. I'm sick of these carriers calling themselves \"uncarriers\" and advertising unlimited data plans. There is no point in having a data plan if you're throttled to 64kbps after 50 gigs.

During this time we never had good service and called every single month when a bill came out due to erroneous charges. At first their way of fixing it was to simply throw money at our bills. When we told them we would rather pay the bill and have service they still never actually fixed the issue. We were constantly waiting on tech support or someone to call us back, which they never did and the problem was never resolved. Finally I asked them to just get rid of the lines and send us a bill for the equipment charges that were left over. We did not have a contract with them so there should not have been any further charges after our last bill. We never received a bill from them for the equipment. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-4540942-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-4540942\"><p>Fast forward six months and they had sent us to a credit collection agency for an outrageous bill that we had never seen! When I asked the credit agency about it they said the company stated it had been sending us notices for 6 mos to a made up address, and the email on file for us. Since the email on file was actually correct we went to check it, there was nothing from them since our last bill that we called about prior to cancelling service. No notices, not other bills, nothing. This company instead used the shady practice of debt parking and just sent this final charge straight to a debt collector. </p><p>We are now trying to get this resolved and I am spending more time and energy on something that I should have never had to deal with in the first place. I cannot begin to explain the amount of frustration this company has put us through. This was the biggest scam and waste of my life ever.

I think his name was SAM. He was more concerned about me taking pictures and said that he would ask me to leave the store. He told me that I can't take pictures and replied I certainly can. Poor customer service is needed to be shared with everyone. Having been in business operations myself having a customer wait that long for a transaction of this type is poor customer service protocol or business objective.

Your employees should learn to multitask when someone needs to pay a bill. This transaction is not time consuming. Making a customer wait is an exercise in negative goodwill. Your company has taken the convenience of using the pay machines out of the stores so your customers have to go to the counter. Please make this experience more efficient by setting it up as a goodwill priority for your PAYING CUSTOMERS. All customers need to be serviced in a timely manner.

But, then, I lost my job very suddenly (Christmas-time. \"Merry Christmas, we're closing our doors forever, immediately.\") from an employer who would not provide me a severance or any additional support. Suddenly, I'm counting pennies and realize the necessity of cutting down on my bills in every way possible.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-4508647-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-4508647\"><p>One of my first decisions was to go to a new phone service provider, where I would save about $70.00 a month based on this new company's rates and the service changes I was willing to make. I called T-Mobile immediately and asked them to clarify for me a shut-off date based on what I've paid for (I had been carrying an out-of-state phone number for years, and decided that if I was going to change providers, I might as well finally get a local number. So, if there was time available to contact people using my old phone number and let them know of the phone number change, I was going to use up whatever time I had already paid for). They gave me that date, and I expected my phone to be shut off, ending my relationship with T-Mobile. So far, so good - the representative had helped me with the info I needed and I acted accordingly.</p><p>The shut-off date came and went. But 2 days after the supposed shut-off date, my credit card got charged with another month of service. I got out my old phone from where I stored it (I had already factory-reset it and put it away), and sure enough, the service was still turned on. I immediately called them, explained the previous request detains to a new representative, and he promised me a credit to my card. That call was 2 days ago.</p><p>Now, today, 2 days later - no credit and the phone is STILL turned on. I called again, and this representative basically said I received erroneous info from both of the other 2 representatives and told me that the new charges were what I owed. When I pointed out that his own company's representatives were why I was expecting a first-of-the-year shut off date and a refund for the new charges, he summarily dismissed my concerns with a general expectation that they would be keeping my money and that there would be no other resolution.</p><p>So, essentially, T-mobile is saying they can tell you whatever they want, whenever they want, but that we have no reasonable right to expect them to stand by the information dispensed by THEIR OWN REPRESENTATIVES. All of my expectations were given to me by their employees and every one of those expectations were shattered by a simple statement from a disaffected employee that I was given \"incorrect information from previous representatives.\" </p><p>Even my angry insistence that they stand by the information they have given out to their customers was dismissed. \"We do not keep notes of the actual conversations and what was said or promised,\" the guy said. Really? Because I heard a message just before he picked up the line saying the calls are recorded. AND, his statement implies the potential that he's calling me a liar. Wow, screw me over on money I can't afford AND call me a liar, and all this without even an apology for their misinformation??

I also would lose Netflix - which I never asked for and never used - getting a much better deal to lose something I never used was a no-brainer. The rep I spoke with said that, if I waited until the cycle ended for the month, I wouldn't get pro-rated charges.

While I was given the impression that my payment would decrease starting January, what they said is that the new plan would kick in in January, and the autopay wouldn't decrease until February. To say this was less than clearly explained when I changed plans is an understatement. I am not happy. </p><p>I've been a customer of theirs for many years, and it is just lately that I constantly have to monitor my bill for charges that shouldn't be there and require a phone call to get them resolved. I don't know what has caused the mindset that seems to dominate T-Mobile now; but perhaps it is time for me to go shopping for another provider. Not that I expect the others to be much better; but perhaps they'll try to work harder to keep a long-time customer.

Part of the trade in allowance was taken off of a new phone in the store and the other part was to be sent in a gift card. We have waited 6 months now with several phone calls inquiring about this gift card that was to be sent in the mail. Tonight I learned that there is no gift card, we must go online to the T-Mobile promotions website and input a bunch of information but there will still be no gift card, it's all VIRTUAL!!! It gives a card number which can only be used online or must be called in and the directions to get to the virtual gift card is a bunch of bull crap!

We gave my older, fully paid for iPhone SE to my son as his first phone and decided to go with T-Mobile pre-paid, or pay as you go, service. It was a great deal at first, then when I refilled the account by phone, the $40 instantly disappeared in a matter of days. I called their customer service from that phone and after quite a long wait and eventual callback, was told that $20 of that payment \"mysteriously\" disappeared, so they put it back. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-4431787-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-4431787\"><p>I started trying to check the phone account more often, but the website showed almost nothing about the account, not even usage info. Smelling a rotten egg, I researched Verizon and it sounded like a much better deal. I soon learned while trying to port his number over that the iPhone SE was locked. We'd never had to unlock a phone before, but I had to go to T-Mobile to have it done. I tried calling customer service at T-Mobile that evening, got immediately put on hold to be transferred to the terrible pre-paid service again. After 15 min. on hold, hung up as I needed to head out.</p><p>Next morning, called customer service with my phone (on a post-paid plan) and the much nicer, more sincere cust. rep answered immediately. She explained the pre-paid phones have a different customer service to assist, and she only could help with post-paid. She also said it's no secret that customer service for prepaid is indeed a joke. Later that day, I went into the downtown Seattle T-Mobile store and a few helpful employees (Mani mainly) took around an hour to figure out how to just send a request to unlock the phone. Their primary concern are post-paid \"normal\" plans, not prepaid, so it took quite an effort for them to even find my phone in their records to start the process. </p><p>Eventually they completed the unlock request, saying I'd get an email from whoever unlocks them. All they left me was a reference number, no actual official paperwork with any details or explanations on what happened next. Just said, \"it'll take up to 24 hours to get that email\". They also agreed the pre-paid customer service a completely different animal in terms of service from post-paid.</p><p>24 hours later, nothing, so I went back to the same store to check. The same customer service rep, Mani, challenged that it hadn't been 24 hours yet, claiming I'd come in a few hours later the day before when I knew I hadn't. He checked, seemingly dismissive as to why I was in his face, and said no info yet. All he could do. And that if I had called customer service, they could tell me the same thing.</p><p>After that, I stopped worrying about it, seeing from google reviews that sometimes this could take days. Then about 40 hours after the unlock request that fabled email finally arrived. Excited, I followed the steps and it didn't work. Not a lot of options on how to fix this, I called T-Mobile post-paid customer service as Mani suggested. The very nice woman said she had no info for me and refuted Mani's suggestion that she could help me. But she dug in and together finally pulled up info - only it was just the same email I'd gotten. I appreciated her hour with me on the phone even though no solution was evident except she told me I should go back to the T-Mobile store to get help again.</p><p>Eventually I figured out the solution on my own and got the phone unlocked. Two store visits, a handful of phone calls, and a useless website over four days was a bit of a nightmare just to simply unlock a phone. It seems T-Mobile is just too big - to completely offshore the pre-paid service to a company woefully inadequate compared to its post-paid service astounded me. I wondered how they keep any business. Sure, they seem to have lots of bonuses, \"free\" phones, etc., but if you try to switch, good luck. Congrats to Verizon on your new customer. After this exercise I'll be better prepared when I leave T-Mobile soon.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-4431787\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-4431787\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-4431787-btn\">\n",

I have one phone that’s on “jump” which is basically a phone lease. Once that lease is up, you can opt to extend payments to keep it and pay it off, or you can trade it in for a new phone. I opted to keep it and did what was necessary to extend the payments. In September I get a $400 bill. I was told they never received the documents I e-signed to extend the payments and they would call me back after they research my options. Over a week later they call me and tell I’m ineligible to extend payments and needed to pay the bill with the cost of the phone included. All they could do was split up the bill into 8 month increments of $50. I agreed. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-4430638-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-4430638\"><p>Now, In December I’m getting a $275 bill. I called and they said I have to pay the $50 payment plan agreed upon plus I still need to pay the $20 device rental I initially tried to sign up for, and they said I was ineligible for back in September. The rep I talked to in September did NOT tell me this and the rep I spoke to in December acknowledged this. So I’m paying $20 for the phone AND an extra $50 for the phone AND the bill from September... How does this make sense?! An extra $70 a month when all I owe on the phone is $163. </p><p>I never got any communication about this, and apparently they credited my account in October $197, which I had no idea about because I’m enrolled in auto pay and assume that the payment is automatically made the same way it has been for nearly 2 years. So they blamed me for no payment in October, even though it should have been taken out and they said a letter was sent to my address. However once I again I received nothing. I offered to just pay the phone off at this point, but the rep said I’d still have to pay the $50 for the next 7 months because that’s what was agreed upon. Basically I would pay for the phone and continue to make payments for the bill from September and the phone, I’d be paying double what I actually even owe. I’ve always paid my bill on time, I’ve done everything T-Mobile reps instructed me to do and somehow they are charging me more. Once my phone is laid I’m off, I’m leaving and never going back.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-4430638\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-4430638\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-4430638-btn\">\n",

Prior to joining the family plan, my husband was a loyal T-Mobile customer on an individual plan and had no issues with his phone. After the T-Mobile rep suggested that we set up a family plan, my husband's phone stopped working instantly. When we got home from the T-Mobile store, he was no longer able to receive calls or make outgoing calls from inside the house. Anytime he received calls from the doctor, he had to schedule them and was forced to go outside to sit in our vehicle for the duration of the call. Again, he is disabled and this was a HUGE hassle. I was also not able to reach him via phone, when he was at home by himself, because his phone did not receive incoming calls. This meant that I had NO way of contacting him in the case of an emergency, or vice-versa. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-4417648-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-4417648\"><p>For the next 6-8 months we spoke with countless T-Mobile reps and technicians and a handful of supervisors (i.e. Jill, Arias, April, etc. ), all of whom made promises they didn't intend to keep. They told us what we needed to hear, to get us off the phone. We were promised only a hundred dollar refund for paying full price for a family plan that only had ONE working phone the entire time. They refused to prorate the bill, in any way, knowing that the phone never worked while on the family plan. We received 2 SIM cards that still did not correct the issue. They blamed my husband's phone which was the same phone he used with his individual T-Mobile plan,in the previous months. </p><p>The fact of the matter is that, the phone did not have any problems until the T-Mobile rep tried to configure it for a family plan. We even asked if they could send over another phone, an older less desirable model, if that would be easier. T-Mobile refused and wanted us to purchase a brand new phone. Many of the reps that we spoke with (well over a dozen reps now) seemed to purposely avoid making note of the issue on our account. Each time we called, they made us explain the whole ordeal over and over, while they pretended to have no knowledge of it. Even after stating that they'd make notes on the acct, once the call ended. We normally spoke with customer service a few times a month, to see if any further progress had been made. After all, we had the same ongoing issue from day one. </p><p>The only thing that the reps managed to fix was the phones ability to receive texts and the web access was still touch and go. It was completely unacceptable. We finally got tired of the games and switched to a new service. About two weeks ago, we noticed that T-Mobile had gone into my bank acct and charged us $173. I spoke with a supervisor and explained that we no longer had the service, along with all of the other unresolved issues. The supervisor promised to refund the money to my account and to remove my info from autopay, since I no longer authorized T-Mobile to have access to my bank acct. We were even given an refund reference number. </p><p>They refunded the money and then took the same amount of money out AGAIN, from my other bank acct, this week. Since December 10, 2018, I have spoken with at least 5 additional reps (one of which pretended to be a supervisor to avoid transferring us to a REAL one) and 1 actual supervisor named, Arias, who was not helpful at all. Leine, one of the More recent T-Mobile reps, was completely professional. She did not even attempt to listen, laughed and played games on the call. We were on the call with Leine for over 30 minutes, and we asked to speak with a supervisor at least 8 times. Each time, Leine refused and ignored the requests, until we notified her that her behavior was unacceptable and we would be contacting the BBB and corporate. At that point, she said, \"She (she being the manager) is on a call.\" I asked if \"she\" was the only manager there, and Leine stated that there were \"a lot of different managers\" there. </p><p>I said, \"Great, then one should be available now.\" Leine assured me that she would to put me in touch with a manager and then transferred me to a rep named, Monica, who tried to pretend to be someone of authority. When we asked what role she played in the company, she stated that she was just another rep. Leine was apparently still listening in on the line. Leine finally transferred us to an actual manager named, Arias, who had a demeanor as if he were the dissatisfied customer who had been jerked around for the past 6-8 months. Arias flat out said, \"There's nothing I can do.\" </p><p>So, I'll be contacting several people regarding this issue. Maybe even the consumer segment on the local news. T-Mobile has done those to too many people and they need to be held accountable for their actions. The reps believe that there will be no consequences for their behavior, since the customer service department is not located in the U.S. So, they are fine with providing service that is less than satisfactory. After all, who can really penalize them, other than the company itself? They are, by far, one of the worst wireless service providers I've ever encountered. I have no problem with outsourcing, at all, just be sure that your customers are receiving quality service.

We ended up paying at least 50 to 80 dollars extra a month for no reason at all and no one could give us a straight answer. Service is AWFUL! They sent us a signal tower that never worked.

They make you agree to their terms under duress which is illegal. Beware. This is what happened to me: I called customer service on November 15 to set up a payment arrangement for my past due bill. Spoke to Summer. She told me that she couldn't do that until the old payment arrangement was taken out of my account. She told me that she would call me the next day when it falls out and she told me that my service will not be cut off.

She told me that the only way that she could restore my service was if I made a payment arrangement for the full amount of my bill which was $380. Initially I only wanted to make a payment arrangement for $150 to be paid on the 20th when I got paid. That was only 3 days away. They couldn't even do that to extend a few days. She wanted me to agree for a payment arrangement for the full $380. </p><p>I use my phone for work and it was already out of service for two hours talking to Cristina and another agent previous her. I lost about $200 already and was losing more the longer my phone was out of service. So I made a payment arrangement to pay $150 on 11/20/18 and $199 on 12/4/18. I told Cristina the only reason I was agreeing 'cause it was under duress from T-Mobile. It was their fault &amp; by giving me misleading information I lost income for two hours that day which comes out to about $200-$300.

T-Mobile like the other carriers offers 0% DOWNPAYMENT on financed or leased phones. Their website states that it's offered to \"well qualified customers\", \"awesome credit\". I was certain that that would not be an issue as my credit is awesome with all 3 main credit bureaus. To My big surprise after T-Mobile ran my credit they told me that I needed $600 down payment for a $750 phone (iPhone XR). I could not believe it since my credit is great and not even getting a car loan has required me to give a down-payment and with the lowest interest (it's a car loan after all). </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-4359595-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-4359595\"><p>I asked T-Mobile store clerks about why I needed to put down pretty much the whole cost of the phone upfront, but their answer was: \"it's what our system shows and we don't know why\". So I tried getting answers from a T-Mobile rep over the phone, T-Mobile Twitter and same answer: \"we don't know\". Lastly I email the CEO John Legere at john.legere@t-mobile.com. I got a response from his executive office team, a Sr specialist. She stated that the main qualifying factor to be a \"well qualified customer\" was T-Mobile's own scoring system which uses multiple \"factors\" to score a new applicant for service and get credit to finance or lease T-Mobile's devices. </p><p>I asked what those qualifying factors were, but she repeatedly said with conviction that no one in the entire company (T-Mobile) including the CEO John Legere knows what those factors are. Not even the team that created that very scoring system. So I asked her if it were possible that those unknown factors might be discriminatory, to what she said \"No\" even though she said that the factors are unknown. So we all can suspect that those factors may be discriminating customers. After all they don't even know.</p><p>One thing is certain, and that is how T-Mobile deceives new customers promising 0% down payment to customers with awesome credit failing to disclose that the \"awesome credit or well qualified customer\" is only based on their own scoring system which may be discriminatory and not on credit worthiness from the main credit bureaus. Want to potentially be discriminated? Like the lack of transparency from a business? Want to be scammed? Go ahead.

I owe $900 on my iPhone X. She said they would mail me a check for $900 to pay it off, also finance a new iPhone XR for 24 months. Today I started reading. First thing I saw was that the max credit to pay off a phone was $650. The very next sentence said that I would be issued a check directly to pay off my phone but that I'd have a credit issued on my T-Mobile account. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-4357093-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-4357093\"><p>Well that isn't what I was told and I don't want a $650 credit on my T-Mobile bill and at the same time owe AT&amp;T $900 for the iPhone X that I no longer would be using. I had intended on paying it off with the $900 and selling it. But I'm not coming out of pocket $900 to be able to unlock the phone to sell it and get $500-700 for it so I called their support number and the guy answered and said he worked for a company called Wireless Fulfillment. He tells me that I have to have paid my current iPhone X down to 50% of the MSRP of the before they will issue me the credit. So in other words the MSRP was about $1100 on my phone, I have to pay it down to $550 and then I'd get the credit on my T-Mobile bill but it's not going to be $900 credit or even the max of $650. It's only half of the original MSRP which would be a credit of $550.</p><p>The saleswoman that came to my office told me that she worked for T-Mobile directly. When we were talking the guy in training inadvertently mentioned their contract with T-Mobile. I looked at her and said, \"You told me that you work for T-Mobile and specifically that you are a W2 employee of them.\" She said, \"No, I meant T-Mobile pays my company and they pay me.\" I asked her the name of her company and unfortunately I didn't write it down but I do know that the name wasn't Wireless Fulfillment which is what the guy answering the phone told me the name of the company was.</p><p>Obviously I'm not getting straight answers. I realize the T-Mobile isn't directly at fault - it's the company they contracted to do the sales but they do share some of the blame for outsourcing their sales I suppose. Either way I'm cancelling. I don't do business with untruthful people. What a waste of 3 hours of time yesterday and an hour today on the phone. That doesn't count the time I spent typing this but this rant was enjoyable at least.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-4357093\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-4357093\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-4357093-btn\">\n",

Before I did, I spoke with 3 different T-Mobile reps to guarantee that my brand new existing AT&amp;T Samsung phones would work on T-Mobile - that they would do WiFi calling, and that I could continue to download contact and calendar data daily WITHOUT BUYING A NEW PHONE. Once I went through the expense of converting and porting, and after I spent 4 days and 20 hours on the phone trying to make it work, they admitted that I DID have to buy a new T-Mobile Samsung (to the tune of $900) to make everything work. Not only did I incur hundreds of dollars in T-Mobile costs and days of my time, but I had to pay hundreds MORE to go back to AT&amp;T when they refused to honor their promises.</p></div>, <div class=\"rvw-bd\"><span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">Original review: Nov. 28, 2018</span><p></p><p>Beginning in early October 2018 wished to CANCEL CELL PHONE BILLING - phone has not worked for at least 2 yrs and finally wished to Cancel.

Thought I would save a few bucks so went ahead and made the move of 4 lines over to T-Mobile. First off, cell phone coverage a mere 5 miles from their store is non existent. Before I even got home, my phone showed \"No Service\". Not only there, but in the entire area I live and work in. T-Mobile said that they had towers there and I shouldn't be having that problem. Big help. They also lied about getting a \"Free\" iPhone XR for trading in my iPhone 6S Plus. What they don't tell you is that the free phone is locked for 3 years or until you pay them off for the phone before your $20/month credit pays it off. Horrible coverage, lied to from the start, and zero interest in helping once I became a customer. Avoid at all costs.</p></div>, <div class=\"rvw-bd\"><span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">Original review: Nov. 26, 2018</span><p></p><p>T-Mobile lies. I was encouraged to switch to a lower cost plan as I told them have no need for the 4th additional line that I have had for so long. They told me this will be the best plan as it is cheaper and faster speed, unlimited 4G data plans for my whole family plan (3 lines). After the switch over I realized my internet service has slow down substantially. I have more difficulty getting internet connection as well. Today I tried to make a call to Texas and I was shocked to hear the voice recording saying that my plan no longer serve that location. That I will be charge per minute if I proceed. This is outrageous lying.

Lately the charger/device even stopped working completely, It is a unethical to even promote such a useless product. I complained but they turned a deaf ear.</p><p>Now again I am tricked the 2nd time with false promises. They told me I will get a much higher data speed (4G) &amp; everything will be the same. After I changed plan it is not what they promised. All said were lies, I can’t believe I have to pay per minute to call Texas and who know where else.

I had a bill sent to me for 414.00, when in fact I had checked with them how much I owed them so; I wouldn't get a bill later.

They kept giving me generic, useless information. They eventually suggested me to talk to Samsung (my phone was Samsung Galaxy S7) and Samsung suggested to talk to T-Mobile.

The process seems simple enough.

I have a contingency plan for this, but the fact that this is happening at all is ridiculous. My phone is essentially being held hostage.

The last representative I spoke to we went through the verification, pin send, and were almost ready to have phone shipped with 0 down but decided to go in store because I wanted the phone today. Waited in store standing for almost 2 hours in pain (I have sciatic nerve damage) only to find out I would be charged a down payment. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-4309219-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-4309219\"><p>Team members in store were amazing and tried to help me by contacting team support and trying to fight for me to at least get my down payment lowered.

I was promised over $200 for every iPhone line that I switched to them. So I wait. And wait. Today I call them about what their hold up is and get this — whoever signed me up over the phone never made mention of my promotion. So that promotion is over and nor will not be honoring it because it wasn’t even mentioned in the memo of my account. Hahahah. What a scam. Keep in mind, it cost me out of pocket money just to switch during that time period from AT&amp;T. My goodness. I feel so scammed right now.

This company cannot handle its merger, volume and customers. And its senior leaders and management don't care. If you are a smart consumer you would do well to spend your money elsewhere.

I went to their store on June 1st to take advantage of the Buy One Get One on the Galaxy S9s. Now initially I had bought the phones with the T-Mobile telesales department but when I called days later to check where the order was I was told it was a system error and it got stuck and never shipped. No one called me, but my money was pulled from my account for more than $900 (because even though the other phone is free you still have to put the deposit down but you get it back). So they canceled the stuck order and told me I could go in the store and pick it up same day and they would waive activation fees. I activated a new line and upgraded the other to get the promo. When I tried to test out the new line it didn't work. I was told it would be active in a couple of days, the line was listed on the contract but was put in reserve. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-4257592-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-4257592\"><p>Long story short after at least 50-60 calls to customer service they finally activated the line in 2 months later in August. I was told the adjustment would be made so that the added line's phone would be free. It is now November and the other phone was never credited. T-Mobile is now saying they can't do anything for me because of the timeframe. I called them weekly to correct the issue. This entire situation is beyond me and once the lines are paid for I'm just going back to my previous carrier. It's not worth saving money monthly to get taken advantage on other things.

I was pay as you go for four years and then this past year and some change I was a \"regular\" customer. I have several issues all at once that I have spent 15 to 20 hours at the store trying to resolve and about 8 hours total on the phone trying to resolve them. There is a lot to unpack here so I will start from the beginning.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-4215254-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-4215254\"><p>When I was crossing over from prepaid to regular I was told I could 3 unlimited phone lines and an unlimited hotspot device line for a certain price, but I forget what it was, but it didn't matter anyway because they said they couldn't make that deal. This is what happens when you think anyone at the T-Mobile store can help you. Now I always make it a point to try to go to the same person every time, no surprises - usually. I ended up getting roped into an unlimited tablet line - which I didn't need because I didn't own a tablet - for the 4th line.</p><p>Still, to this day, almost 2 years later, I still don't have primary account holder access. It shows my phone number AS primary and they politely tell me this over the phone, but I can't make changes, I can't use Netflix, I can't set parental controls for my kids' line if they have such a thing. I wouldn't know because I don't have access. I have tried calling in about, but they are full of energy and no follow through. They are nice as can be and excel and being ineffectual. That's not even the most frustrating part.</p><p>Some time ago, not sure of the date, but they can pull it up... But I got a phone for my wife because hers broke. While I am there, they ask me if I wanted a free tablet. Reluctantly I said yes. (Word of advice - just say no.) I was told I would put $80 down, but would receive it back in $3 bill credits. This never happened. Actually, the opposite happened and the same people in the store who made it to happen couldn't make it unhappen. (Frustration building) After spending hours in the store trying to resolve said issue I called in about it. They immediately gave me $15 bill credit and said they would escalate it and the primary account holder issue, but I didn't hear back from them and the issues are still there.</p><p>Finally, I got my wife the S9+, purple, lilac as they call it. I remember talking with the representative about being crazy not to have insurance on such an expensive device. Well through the unnatural course of time and very unfortunate event - my wife lost her phone. When she goes to the store she is informed that phone DOES NOT have insurance in it. The representative remembers the conversation I had with him after I tell my wife about what I said. He then, with the manager onlooking and giving advice, he says he will try something, for us to wait 48 hours and then submit the claim. We do so. Less than 24 hours later the insurance company tells us that \"after a thorough investigation the phone was not covered during the time of the loss.\" I am beyond words despondent over the situation because The phone cost almost $1,000. </p><p>Shortly after they denied the claim, my wife goes into the hospital for five days. I go into the store to get a new sim for my phone and to ask about the disposition of the S9+ and he and the manager both say, \"nope, sorry, there's nothing more we can do.\" It could have been just my imagination, but it looked to me like he and the manager exchanged looks, but I dunno. Basically he tells me I just have to eat the cost of an S9+ because of what he later called a \"system failure to register the insurance\" at the time of the sale and there was nothing they could do. Does that sound legit to you? </p><p>Anyway, about a week or so after that encounter I call 611 to complain about the situation because the more I think about it, the madder I get. After speaking with them and their supervisor, who I didn't ask for - they volunteered to get him, he told me he would apply $50 toward my bill. However, when they applied the credit, they applied it to the tablet they told me would be free that they charged me for. So they applied $50 to money they already owed to me. Anyway, I honestly thought the rep simply forgot to add the insurance and tried to fudge the system somehow, mainly because of the sheer lack of support. Don't get me wrong, they some of the very nicest people you will ever have to deal with. Albeit, they claim it was a system error that didn't attach the insurance to the sale so it opens the door to reasonable doubt, but it opens other doors too.</p><p>Like, if that was the case, then why not go that route in the first place vs. telling me there's nothing they can do and to keep paying for a phone that I don't have that should have been covered by insurance in the first place. A \"T-MOBILE EXPERT\" calls me after I complain the first time and I have to start the whole story ALL over again because he kept trying to tell me the phone was an LG phone, (which the CURRENT phone was), and that the line already had insurance on it and... By this time, it is all I can do to maintain composure. I would pack up and go somewhere else, but there isn't anywhere else to go - I like T-Mobile, I don't want to have to switch - I can't stand the other choices out there for varying reasons. </p><p>So after a series of being put on holds he tells me the S9+ was a leased phone which automatically has insurance, to go back to the store where I got it, ask for a manager to open my account and read the notes, pay the $175 deductible, and get another one. Not so. Not in the slightest. I couldn't remember his name. I was working outside in the mud trying to tell him to call me back after work, but to no avail. (It seems to me that a high tech phone company could see when my phone number came into their call center and which station it rang to and which tech was working that station. I dunno.) Anyway, I get to the store, and wouldn't you know it? The notes do not reflect no such an activity. </p><p>So I called the ”Expert\" line that called me on Monday and I had to start the entire process all over again because the rep said the notes weren't clear and when he tried to call customer support they didn't have that information. While on the phone I ended up having to ask for the supervisor because the tech on the other end was only following protocol and not really able to think for herself, just read a script and move on, very ineffectual. (The phone is an LG phone and it has insurance on it... Over and over again) Finally, FINALLY, I get a supervisor. Finally I get somewhere with someone on the phone, her name was Mari, OUTSTANDING professionalism and people skills. I could immediately see why she was a supervisor. </p><p>We finally get to a resolution center to resolve my issue. However, the tech who told me the bit about all lease phones automatically having insurance... I don't remember his name because, like I said, I was working, outside, in the dirt speaking to him on speaker phone so I can keep working. He also told me that my tablet issue was taken care of and that my issue with me being primary account holder and having primary account holder authority were resolved too... Nope, is as it was except the S9+ issue is resolved... I think. You see they tell me it will \"appear\" like I will be charged the full amount for the phone, but when it cycles through they will take off everything except the $175 I already paid them.</p><p>So far it looks like I'm getting fully charged, but we will see. I really would like to have the two other issues remedied someday and to get the money they owe me for the tablet too. I would be ecstatic with a bill credit, but it seems customer service can't get their poop in one sock unless you call... And keep calling and repeat your story every-single-time. It's exhausting. I wonder if they do it on purpose, to make extra money. Most customers just forget about stuff like this and take it I guess. I used to be one of them.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-4215254\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-4215254\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-4215254-btn\">\n",

It was my Birthday and I had received a gift of an Apple watch from my partner. He had bought it just a few hours before giving it to me. Upon receipt I saw on the side sticker it was black so I said I'd go to T-Mobile to change it to my preferred rose gold. The first person I met in the store responded with a snooty \"oh am well that will cost you $50!!\" I was completely blown away, I was like... This was just bought a few hours ago. It's completely untouched, in the T-Mobile bag with receipt. Didn't matter! What kind of appalling customer service is this, to literally treat your bill paying customers in this manner, literally robbing customers. RESTOCKING FEE a few hours after buying something. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-4213409-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-4213409\"><p>I then spoke to customer service. Then the manager and another two T-Mobile employees. None of whom were budging and could not care less that they had caused me so much upset on my birthday! One of them actually said that it was a charge from Apple. Well I spoke to Apple and that is not the case, if I was to do this exact exchange with Apple I would not have been charged this penalty. It is a robbing fee from T-Mobile. I will now go into T-Mobile today RETURN the Apple watch for my money back. Cancel myself and my partner's bill paying phone accounts. Go to Apple and buy my product DIRECT and switch to another phone company. It is NOT the $50 (which I still think is robbery) it is the principle of the care I was given and the fact it left me so upset. I WILL NEVER darken the door of T-Mobile again.

I was calling in multiple times and letting them know that I wasn't getting any services, my calls were getting dropped and my text messages were coming in late. They supposedly troubleshooted it and it was supposed to work now. Well surprise, it was still NOT working. I kept calling back and paying my phone bill every month. Finally they said to get a new phone and it was the phone, so I went in and got a new phone. Surprise! AGAIN it still was not working. I got upset and didn't pay my phone bill. They suspended my line and when I called in, they not only charged me a late fee for EACH line but refused to hear me out or try to resolve my problem. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-4209218-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-4209218\"><p>I called back and their solution this time was that, \"my lines were under Verizon and that's why it wasn't working and now it is under T-Mobile and should work now... and it STILL was not working properly. Now, I finally said, \"Screw it, cancel my lines, I will go elsewhere,\" and then they apologized and said they would take care of my bill and the late fees that they kept stacking on my account. I wasn't going to keep paying for services I was not getting and so the customer service rep for the \"LOYAL\" team reached out and said they would pay for my bill. She promised to call two days later to see how my service was working and to proceed with the promise. </p><p>Two days later, I never got a response or a call. I called them and all of a sudden, that promise wasn't noted. Mind you when you call T-Mobile, they state that all calls are recorded. I was transferred to 3 people, one of them a supervisor. She didn't care what I was going through and what I have had to deal with already, she just didn't care. Finally I told her to have the rep who promised me to call me. So we set up a time, they called me and asked for a specific appointment call and then I waited. I never got a call and about a day later, the rude supervisor called me back, apologized and said they would take care of the bill since it was promised. She said to give her about 2 to 3 days and she would clear my account. </p><p>Well a week went by and the charges were still there. I called back today to talk to someone and they practically told me that they weren't doing anything and nothing was noted. When I asked to speak to the supervisor I talked to since everything was \"noted\", they rejected my request and said they couldn't do that and that their policy changed. I will be changing carriers and making sure to pass it along to friends, family, customers, clients, co-workers and everyone I know about T-Mobile's service.

In addition to paying a $50 restocking fee, I discovered later that I was being charged for the associated \"line\" - even two months after returning it.

Every time we call in, we are told something different and now T-Mobile blames us for issues they caused! I was told that I needed to turn in my S7 Edge under my old plan or pay for it, so I turned it in and got a new lease under my dad's plan.

So let me explain. After 11 years of loyalty to this company I hear they had military discounts and my husband is a veteran so we switched my account to his name to save money, so far everything seem awesome until I got a bill for over 1000 saying I owe them and I knew that was wrong. We were up to date without bill, so I went to my local store. I explained to the gentleman what happened. He call their home office and they all agreed it was a huge mistake they had made. They were charging my phone which was transferred to my husband’s account and he was making payments for it but at the same time they were charging me for it. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-4184054-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-4184054\"><p>He said it would take a few weeks to come off my bill from my old account. Well I got a new bill saying I still owe them over $900 but when I went into the store the guy said I only owe about $280. And yes I agreed because two of the phones could not be transferred to my husband account. They were also charging me for a hotspot I have in my house because we get no signal so I explain to them why I still had it because we were still customers with them so they say to keep it. Well a few weeks after that I got another bill saying they send me to collections after me talking to many of their customer service people and even some supervisors and everyone agreed it was a T-Mobile mistake. </p><p>Well after calling and calling and calling now they are telling me because my old account is close and there is nothing they can do about it and I have to deal with the third party company, so I told the supervisor “You are telling me I have to pay money that I clearly don’t owe you guys.\" He said they have no record of my account anymore because my account is closed now. WHAT??? They are stealing my money. I agree to pay about 300 probably even less than I owe them but where is the other 600 coming from. And why would my account go to collections when I’m trying to fix their mistake. Ahhhh I’m so frustrated. How can they expected the third party company to believe that it was T-Mobile mistake and I do not owe that much money? Of course they are not. </p>\n",

I wasn't happy with the quality of the service either, my internet was constantly cutting out and my service signal never had more than 2 bars.

The custom service representative told me I have an outstanding debt of over $1000. This was a shock to me since I pay for all of my bills with autoplay and my device has been paid off in full after about three months. I've asked her to explain why is this showing up she said she doesn't have that information and gave me a phone number for collections agency. I called the number she gave me and they told me there is no debt associated with my name, phone number or SSN! That was just the beginning of my troubles! </p><p>After receiving my next bill I got entirely confused by the dates on it. My billing period was from September 11th to October 10th but in the detailed description it said I was paying for services from October 11th to November 10th. And I had already canceled my service on October 11th. After calling customer service to clarify what I'm being billed for no one could explain anything and I kept being bumped to next level of expertise. I've spent over 90min on the line speaking to multiple \"experts\". I've been told multiple contradictions such as \"your account is postpaid so you're paying for the services you've already used\" and then 5min later \"you are being charged for the month in advance because that is the type of account you have with us, I'm sorry if no one told you this before\". </p><p>After going back and forth for what seemed like an eternity I finally gave up trying to understand what I'm paying for and asked if that will be my final bill. Imagine my surprise when I was told no. Turns out because I had ONE day of service in the next billing period I am required to pay for the entire month! The explanation behind it was because I transferred my number to a different carrier that's also powered by T-Mobile. This made absolutely zero sense, I've never heard of such a thing so I started arguing. The customer service representative kept intentionally putting me on hold over and over again and pretended that he couldn't hear me while I could clearly hear him.</p><p>In the end he said I have to pay this bill (for whatever period it is) and after that I will get a final bill for only one day (instead of the whole month). He said he had put a note on my account for me to only be billed for one day! Apparently you need to call and argue if you don't want to pay for the services you haven't used! That is considering they actually honor that and don't bill me the full sum next month, we'll see! I'd advise everyone to stay away from T-Mobile. They will rip you off any chance they get and provide poor quality service for the money!</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-4178354\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-4178354\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-4178354-btn\">\n",

Services were added to my account without informing me. I am not even sure why does this phone service exists. You cannot get service in many areas around US. They are highly over-priced looking at the low service coverage. Do not get this phone service.</p></div>, <div class=\"rvw-bd\"><span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">Original review: Oct. 7, 2018</span><p></p><p>I recently ordered phone service from T-Mobile through my employee promo program. I got a sales rep on the phone who was located in TX and he happily walked me through the process of what was being offered and finally explained to me. I would be paying about $500 down to process my order. If I wanted it to be overnighted I would pay about $518 and some change. I agreed to do that only to later find out it would not be sent overnight but a few days later. Then I see on my bank statement I was charged about $668 and change. I don't know where this amount comes from. I am very angry about this. I'm a reasonable person but I was not told I would have to wait for any reason for the phone. Having to wait for it is not even the biggest issue. It's the fact that I was lied to. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-4144523-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-4144523\"><p>I called T-Mobile back about this and was told they did not charge that amount. At first I thought it was a connection fee but the rep told me that would be waived. T-Mobile said they did not charge a connection fee when I spoke with them so now that cost is a mystery. To make matters worse, I received documents to sign by email and after signing it I saw where the color on one phone is wrong (I ordered two phones). When ordering the phone I was very clear of the color I wanted. I asked for both phones to be ocean blue. The document states blue and one purple. I called T-Mobile back about this only to be told when the phones arrive I would have to send the wrong one back, pay for it to be sent back and then get reimbursed. </p><p>This makes no sense at all! I did not make the mistake, the rep did! I'm not yet officially a T-Mobile customer and already I have a bad taste in my mouth about the experience. I'm at the point I want a full refund and T-Mobile keep those phones and I'll go elsewhere! This overall experience has been highly disappointing. At this point I don't want to recommend T-Mobile to anyone and it's sad because I feel they used to be a good company at one time. I don't know what happened.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-4144523\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-4144523\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-4144523-btn\">\n",

I went into T-Mobile local office (Grand Junction Colorado) 1 year ago to purchase their services. I already had 2 phones and a tablet. I needed 4 lines and had 3 devices. I was purchasing a new Samsung but the manager at the store said I could get a second phone that I had to pay some of the bill upfront. I told him I just needed 1 phone and he said in would get the rebate of a little over 800.00, after being pushed via a hard sell, I grudgingly agreed to get the second phone. The manager then submitted my claim via the internet and was told it could be up to 2 months before I received the prepaid debit card. I waited the full 2 months and heard absolutely nothing from T-Mobile. Went back to local store and the same manager was there. He looked up my account and said something was wrong and he submitted it again (although he couldn't or wouldn't tell me what was wrong). </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-4140266-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-4140266\"><p>So once again I was told it could be up to 2 months. So here we go again. I waited a full 2 months and heard nothing from them again. At this time I was pissed off because I really didn't want or need the phone they SOLD ME. I then called T-Mobile and went through several different operators. I finally got someone that spoke English that I could understand and they told me that in order to get the rebate you have to be 100% payments on time through the entire process. So here's the deal, you sign up for a BOGO free phone and they sit on your account for, I'd guess 4 to 8 weeks. If anytime during this process you get behind, for even 1 day, then you lose the deal and you pay full price for a phone you would have never purchased if they didn't HARD SALE it to you.</p><p>Now don't get me wrong. I understand 100% that you should pay your bills on time, all the time, and giving you an incentive to pay your bill on time so you get the rebate, but here's my problem. I was never, not 1 time, told that if I was 1 day behind on my bill that I would be disqualified from the BOGO phone. I was also never shown a paper or a digital EUA. The BOGO deal is a scam and they don't give, even 1 week, of a buffer. I mean literally that if I got sick and went into the hospital. And got out 1 day after my bill was due and I went down to the local store and paid my $135.00 bill that it would cost me $800.00+ because I was penalized for getting sick.</p>\n",

      "                            After I found out what happened they did agree to extend the date and give me a chance, but by this time I had lost my job and couldn't get my account current.<p>I was depending on that money and if I hadn't been lied to then I should have had that money 8 weeks after I signed with them in would have just paid the phone off and my bill would have sent down, but this was like a domino effect in the sense that I didn't want to have to pay the extra 35.00 per month for this phone. Now I'm basically screwed and I end up paying 800.00 bucks for a phone I wasn't even trying to buy when I signed up. Folks this is criminal, unethical and immoral. If I did something like that to someone I'd go to jail, but big corporations get away with these deceptive unethical practices.</p><p>My advice, if presented with a BOGO deal please make sure to get a copy of terms and conditions, read every single word on it. I don't care if it takes 2 hours. If you don't understand ANYTHING AT ALL, make sure to record their responses to your questions. If you walk into the store 10 minutes before they close you make them stay there until 100% of your questions are answered and answered in a way you understand. T-Mobile probably isn't the only lying, thieving, deceptive company out there. BE CAREFUL.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-4140266\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-4140266\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-4140266-btn\">\n",

I completed the order; however, one of my phones was back order, so I was told that I would have to wait for a few days to get my phone. I called almost every day for a week. Then, I called after a week, then came to find out they canceled my order. I was shocked. I waited for a week for the phone, and they told me my order was canceled. I asked them why, they said because my credit card was declined. I did received an alert from my CC company to verify if I approve for the order.

You would think they would honor my order since nobody notify me and it wasn't my fault that the transaction was declined. After I talked to a few agents, they were very nice, they kept telling me that since the promotion was over, there was nothing they could do. Nobody could give me credit for $700 on the acct? I was on the phone, pretty upset and disappointed because I was excited about going to T-Mobile and getting my new phones. They just lost me forever!!!

I thought the $115 + tax was just for the new phone as an second line phone charges. He did NOT mention to me what was the real deal... According to the real deal was $84.00 + tax for two lines as promised a month.Shocking to see a $157.+ tax on my bill without my knowledge and agreement. I told them I wanted to return the two tablets because that was not the agreement.</p><p>They told me I had to pay $50.00 per each tablet restocking fees $100.00. I refused, I was told to call customer care that is was possible they might waive the restocking fees. Customer care said to call back to the store that is their decision if wanted to waive the restocking fees, their decision was NOT. Both tablets total price that I noticed is $144.00 couple of days I've noticed $96.00 + $96.00 for each tablet. Back in 2017 a similar situation accrued with an pocket socket for phone when I wanted to pay cash and when I did without my knowledge turned out to be the down payment, to this day am still making payments on this pocket socket.

When we went to their store in Biloxi the employee told us that they will pay our contract off and we dont need to worry about anything, we let them check our phones, everything is good (he said) and all we need to do is to send the phone, go to Carrier Freedom site, and send our last bill. He said we will get a credit card to pay our contract off. We paid almost $700 upfront and $215 for our first bill, after a couple of days the problems just started happening, from mixing our phone numbers to disconnecting our networks to changing our sim cards and everything, it was a mess!

After 2 days we didn't get nothing, so today we went there again. The girl employee told us that we will only get $49 and that they will deduct $184 to the cp that we got from them, we asked for more information because this is not what they told us upfront, she was saying it was a miscommunication and she was already getting irritated with my mother in law. First of all, T-Mobile these are all your mistakes, you made us feel bad about asking questions when it's your faults why we are here complaining to you.

First, the data-only plan management is not integrated with the My T-Mobile site: it requires a login to my.t-mobile.com, then a redirect to mim.t-mobile.com, then another login. The credentials may need to be different because the first will accept a phone number and the second will not. Also, a different email is required for each account, even if old accounts are inactive; this may require the user to have many different email addresses in order to use the service.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-4093505-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-4093505\"><p>T-Mobile has \"on demand passes\" and \"monthly plans\". These are the same except that the prices vary and the monthly plans require auto-renew. I chose a monthly plan because the price was a bit lower. When I no longer needed the data plan, I decided to unsubscribe from the auto-renew. I had trouble finding the way to cancel the plan. Finally I found a tiny \"Looking to cancel?\" link on the \"add plan\" page. I was concerned about clicking the link because I was planning to use the rest of the data during the remainder of the cycle. Instead, in a few days the plan auto-renewed and I was charged an extra $100 for service I did not need or want. I contacted T-Mobile about this and explained the situation.</p><p>I had not used any of the service. In fact, the associated device had been powered off for several days so exactly 0 bytes of the new plan had been used. I was told that the charge could not be refunded. I did not find this to be acceptable, so I opened a dispute with my credit card provider. I was given a refund for the charge. Many months later, I was interested in activating the service again. I tried to purchase an on-demand pass, but the payment failed. I called T-Mobile and was transferred about 12 times (seriously), had to call back about 4 times, was somehow transferred to AT&amp;T; Prepaid support (what?!)...</p><p>I wonder if part of this is because their \"call back\" feature was sending me to postpaid support when I called prepaid support? Anyway, I finally found out from a payment department supervisor that the payments were failing because of a block on the account from that $100 disputed charge. So, in due course they treated me like a criminal and told me my account could not accept payments by phone or credit card unless I paid the $100 amount. My next attempt was to close the affected account, but after again being transferred around repeatedly, I gave up. I have moved to Red Pocket's GMSA (AT&amp;T;) plan.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-4093505\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-4093505\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-4093505-btn\">\n",

When I purchased my 2 Note 8 devices I wanted to sign up with Samsung premium care plan which is 12 dollars a month just like T-Mobile but only $99 deductible if phone breaks due to accidental damage. T-Mobile told me to get insurance from them because it's the same exact coverage and only $99 for broken phone claim. Well not to find out over a year later that it was all a freaking lie and it's actually $175. What a bunch of liars. Don't EVER trust T-Mobile -_-. We are now considering moving all our phones and services from T-Mobile due to many issues not just this one but this pretty much broke the straw.

Now to make matter worse they charge me or as they say put a hold of the amount 35.11 and now wants me to redo the order and recharge me the 35.11 instead of listening to me and resend the sign email to my phone number in which they can't do because the girl seem useless and not really understanding of her job. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-4084865-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-4084865\"><p>She know who she is and then has the nerve to transfer me to another person after being on the phone for 2 hours.

How can you transfer a call to a person that has no idea unless you tell them the problem? So let me get this straight.

We signed up for T-Mobile's Jump on Demand service, which lets you upgrade your phone up to three times within an 18 month period. Last year, we stood up until 3:AM to grab an early order for the iPhone X which we were told by the phone rep, we'd get on launch date. Launch day came, iPhone X arrived. All good.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-4084256-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-4084256\"><p>This year, it was entirely different. We decided we wanted larger screens, so we went for the upgrade to iPhone XS Max. Once again, we waited until 3:AM as we are on the East Coast. At 10 minutes to, I called customer support to ask what is the best way to go about upgrading. My reply was - \"Just go to our site and order it from there when it's time because over the phone we will charge a fee, plus you will have to pay for shipping.\" What? Last year we did it by phone and there were no additional charges. I asked if he could at least let me know what our upgrade price will cost. He said, \"Based on your Jump on Demand Plan, $99.00.\"</p><p>At 2:55:AM, I go online and notice the new iPhones are already up, but our upgrade price shows $379.00 per phone (we have 2). I was flipping out. I called back, and once again, I get an outsourced rep. I tell her my situation and she says \"don't worry, the reason why the price is high is because it's not 3:00 yet. At 3:00, you will see the price will be $99.00\". I get off the phone and wait - and wait... it's now 3:10, and the price hasn't changed. I knew she was wrong! We decide to add the phones to our cart to see what the total will be. It won't even let me check out as the message shows Jump on Demand customers must upgrade by phone or order directly through one of our stores. So, first customer rep was incorrect, second customer service rep was a joke. I call back a third time, and now they're closed. So I do some research and find another number.</p><p>Now I get a US agent. I explain my situation, and he tells me I was given wrong information. \"It's definitely $379.00 per phone to upgrade because you haven't been with us 3 years and actually it's not enough months to even qualify for an upgrade at all.\" I was like WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT??? He said, \"Hold on, let me check something.\" He gets back on and apologizes that he made a mistake. \"Yes, you can upgrade, and I can take your order by phone.\" So we give him our credit card, and have to pay 2 x $379.00 plus tax = over $400.00 per phone and $25.00 for 18 months. He was all chummy and patronizing with his fake, overly friendly \"we're there for you\" nonsense. I asked him twice... \"We ARE getting these on Launch day right?\" He said, \"Oh for sure - it's very cool that you'll get both phones on Friday, the launch day - you made it in!\"</p><p>No info all week. Website says \"processing\". The day before launch arrives and people are starting to get tracking numbers, but many don't, us included. I now see a lot of people complaining that their order is shipping UPS GROUND with delivery the following week. I decide to hit Twitter and grab the attention of customer service with a little public complaining. A rep was able to find my tracking number. I key it in, and sure enough, it shows it will be shipped Ground! How will our order get here in one day if they're using Ground? Maybe the hub is close enough? Later in the day, it finally shows the more details as it is now in transit with an ETA of 4 days for transit! Forget Friday, it's now scheduled for Tuesday, the following week.</p><p>What's the point of staying up late to get a phone on launch day if it's not arrive on that day? Non-Jump on Demand customers were able to use the web or app to order, but they had shipping choices, so if you wanted it on launch day, you had to pay for overnight. These are all new rules that T-Mobile implemented this year but never explained this to anyone! Not to mention, Jump on Demand customers had no choice of shipping options by phone.</p><p>It's not just this iPhone launch that has me angered, but during our time with T-Mobile, we've gotten offers to change our plan around which they claimed would save us money, only later to see our bill rise in price. We were once again given incorrect information and had to switch back to our original plan and demand credit (which they did give us). TWICE we changed plans based on recommendations and TWICE they cost us more. T-Mobile customer service is absolutely a disaster. Every time you call you will always get different answers. They are the most ill informed employees ever. I will not upgrade through T-Mobile ever again. I'll just pay off the phone in the least amount of months possible, then, the next time I need upgrade, I'll go direct with Apple.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-4084256\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-4084256\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-4084256-btn\">\n",

Otherwise, you will have to get all the frustration coming from the unlock process. When I requested to unlock my iPhones, the process was so easy. I accidentally mentioned the reason I wanted to unlock because I want to change my carrier. It is probably the reason leading to all the problems. Within 12 hrs, I received an email with unlock reference and unlock instructions (just plug in non-T-Mobile sim card and that's it). I thought T-Mobile was so nice, but it's not. The unlock didn't work. I called back and forth like 10 times. They push responsibility to Apple, but Apple insist that they do nothing with lock/unlocking devices. It must be done from the carrier.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-4073039-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-4073039\"><p>After the last call, there is a lady called me back and convinced me to go to T-Mobile store for physical assistance.

She told me to call her back or she would call me back in 30 mins. An hour later, I didn't receive her call back, and I'm not able to reach her. The current representative could identify who called me earlier but refused connecting me to her. And then this representative started a new request. It is like starting everything over again while this has been done a week ago. So I insisted to talk to the previous representative, and then she told me that the previous lady asked me to go to Apple store, not T-Mobile store. </p><p>I was like wtf??? She fooled me to waste more time, because I was an annoying customer? In 10 calls I made, they all mentioned that I should have my phone unlocked by 24 hrs.

I never received a phone number after paying $10 for my SIM card. They tell me it is on reserve status. Three times they put in a work ticket and I never heard back from them. It is amazing this company still exists with this amount of lousy customer service. Really, really poor service.</p></div>, <div class=\"rvw-bd\"><span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">Original review: Sept. 1, 2018</span><p></p><p>T-Mobile is the absolute worst! I've only had my service for one day and this experience is awful! I go to purchase my phone, the guy Theordore who works at the Carolina Pavillion location did not set up my sim card, so I couldn't make calls. He also entered my pin wrong so I had to deal with that, and not to mention I was on hold for almost 3 hours trying to get a representative only to be told my pin number was incorrect! I'm over this damn company. Do not use T-Mobile!

Because the phones that we brought over were perfectly fine until the service switched and we had to spend $1,600 on 2 new phones if we wanted to talk on them... the data worked fine...

Now, we can't make calls from our home or receive calls over wifi or through the cell network. I get voicemails after the phone never ringing or any notification of an incoming call. 1 out of 5 calls go through. 1 out of 3 - 5 text go through and I'm 5 feet from a working router and internet service!</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-3996510-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3996510\"><p>Cell coverage is terrible.

If you have a business account with T- Mobile you are given a rep who will call and/or send emails with \"special offers\" of \"free\" products with either a low or no data fee (eg tablets.). I have even been told when I said I wouldn't use it \"why not get it anyway; you can give it away as a gift\". I fell for this and for the emails that have FREE IN BOLD TYPE. I even asked specifically if this would cost anything and was assured it would not. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-3990690-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3990690\"><p>Now fast forward a year - I find that I am being charged monthly for the device and for service. I contacted the new rep (they turn over regularly) who was going to look into it and never got mad. The next time I was contacted by still another new rep I explained the problem. This one directed me to customer service. I finally, after a lengthy conversation got her to agree to refund the data fees but not the cost of the tablets. She also claimed she couldn't even find one of the offers. A subsequent call to the new rep was never returned. In June I called and canceled my service. I now find they only canceled the phone line but continued to charge data usage for the tablets! A friendly customer service rep arranged to refund the past month but not the previous month. I freely admit that I was not scrupulous in monitoring bills so I didn't catch these errors in a timely way. I claim naiveté and trust that businesses charge what they claim.

What a great scam! Fast forward a few months, no gift card and now T-Mobile claims we were never eligible for the free phone, now they claim there was a requirement to trade in certain phones to get this deal, that was never mentioned in the tv commercial nor by the rep.

I called a month before I switched and specifically asked the representative about my corporate discount, they looked it up and confirmed without a doubt that I was eligible for the discount. Now 6 month later, after speaking with numerous support and business representatives, that I am not eligible for the discount. I would not have signed up if this discount did not apply. Every other phone company applies this discount, I've had AT&amp;T and Verizon and they both honor this corporate discount. Anytime you sign up with someone who makes promises, get them in writing first. It's a sales ploy that T-Mobile is using and it stinks.</p></div>, <div class=\"rvw-bd\"><span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">Original review: Aug. 2, 2018</span><p></p><p>Wow, what a disappointment T-Mobile turned out to be. I had been with AT&amp;T for nearly 20 years when I made the switch to T-Mobile. The person at the store was very friendly and helpful up to the point where I was told I had to put down a deposit on the new phones we wanted. I asked how much of a deposit we have to put down for the iPhone 8's we are wanting. The clerk tells me $360.00 for each phone plus I have to pay the taxes up front on both for a total of more than $800.00. I asked why such a high deposit. The clerk tell me it's my credit. I have an excellent credit rating with all three credit bureaus. So I asked for more details and was informed I would have to call the credit department at T-Mobile.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-3891519-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3891519\"><p>They turn out to be as helpful as the clerk at the store. So the iPhone 8 is $699.99 each plus tax and you get a gift card for $700.00 when you sign up for a 24 month plan. You pay an additional fee on your plan for the first iPhone of $29.99 for that 24 months or until you pay off the first phone. T-Mobile wants me to pay $720.00 plus the taxes on both phones up front, then I will get a gift card for the second phone in the amount of $700.00. At which point both phones will be paid off and I will no longer be under a contract. Looks like the T-Mobile BOGO promotion is a scam. Also I was told, that if I stayed with T-Mobile for a year and didn't miss any payments, they wouldn't check my credit.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-3891519\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-3891519\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-3891519-btn\">\n",

For Christmas in 2017 I added my grandson onto my account and got him a phone. While adding him on I was told I should be at the 55 plus rate which would bring my bill down to $35.00 a line. This was offered to me and not something I requested. The way it was explained to me was that it was an add on to the plan I had which would lower my cost $5.00 per line. My grandson has enlisted in the military and decided to get his own service. He went to Verizon and got a good deal and new phone with the trade in for the one I just got him.

But I was wrong.</p><p>The rep started to say that I had been being charged $75.00 per month for one line and that she could put me on the 55 plus which would lower it to $55.00. When I questioned her why it wasn't going back to the $35.00 she told me it was because I had switched plans and that she couldn't recall any $40.00 per month plan that they offered! (Remember the commercials for it and the big pink posters in their stores?)</p><p>I informed her I was not okay with that and that I expected the same plan I had before I added the extra line. She put me on hold, came back and said her manager said they couldn't do anything for me and that they too didn't remember the $40.00 per line w/taxes included promotion. I told her to look at my bills and see how much I was paying. She said she did but there was nothing she could do except put me on the 55 plus plan. I will be going back to Sprint.

Only one tech was brave enough to give me his ID number while all the others hid under first names like ** actors. I even stopped into my local T-Mobile shop in Westford, MA where I met two people behind the counter in an empty store. They clearly had no interest in me or my problem and I was finally told there was nothing they could do. </p><p>It is obvious T-Mobile has made a big push to compete with the dominant players in the industry even though their coverage sucks in comparison. They like to lie about that also. I've had to rent signal boosters in my 'good coverage' zone to use my phone at home.

The last straw was when one of the specialist switched the auto pay from my son's card to my bank account without our knowledge or permission. When we heard that the 600 and 700 mhz service was good in rural areas we decided to give them another try. Two months in and I have spent half my life trying to work with the office of the president to no avail. When we went into the store we were told that they would pay our switching fees from our old carrier. I even asked them to \"double check\" and was assured we would be paid for all four of our devices. My son and daughter live in another state and the salesperson at that store sold him a phone which apparently deducted 310.00 off switching fees which was never explained. My daughter turned in an Essential which we still to this day have not been reimbursed for. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-3850288-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3850288\"><p>When we asked for the phone back since they were not going to pay what they promised they will not return! Basically they hijacked the phone. We waited as we were instructed for the last bill from our previous carrier. We turned it in only to have them tell us a phone was reimbursed the last time we were with T-Mobile, however, my daughter never turned in a phone and the two of the specialist verified that no phones were turned in. Consequently, I wrote the Better Business Bureau and the Office of the President has now given us different information. They claim a phone was turned in and a card was issued for it in in the past, however, they sent the card to someone other than the account holder. They are so disorganized at the expense of an innocent consumer. This has been going on for a month and now it puts us past the 14 day return period.</p><p>Bottom line is that T-Mobile sales associates lied to us and gave us bad information over and over until it was too late to change our minds. Had they given us correct information to begin with; we would never have switched back. Nobody at T-Mobile has access to the proper information to give to consumers to base their decisions on. This is very deceptive and should not be allowed. They \"took\" my daughter's phone and will not return it and haven't reimbursed what it was worth. We would have turned the phone back to the previous carrier and gotten more than what we were given for the phone had the T-Mobile rep given us accurate information. </p><p>We are senior citizens now stuck with a huge bill from our previous carrier we were not anticipating based on lies told to us by several T-Mobile employees. We will have to pass on needed medical appointments in order to pay our previous carrier. We could never recommend T-Mobile to anybody. They lie to the consumer and they took our phone without reimbursement. T-Mobile has been a NIGHTMARE for us and we wish we never switched back.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-3850288\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-3850288\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-3850288-btn\">\n",

I have been a loyal customer of theirs for almost 15 years. I have brought them so much customers and business and I've been doing that for free. Yes, FREE. During a hard time (hitting rock bottom with two kids to feed and bills to pay) in my life, I thought, \"Why not get paid for what I'm already doing - which is pushing the company's name to different people?\" I thought to apply, send my resume online, and even check up on my status. T-Mobile decided not to move forward with my application with no contact except to tell me... \"T-Mobile decided not to move forward with my application.\" Then I've decided to move on and try a couple of the independent stores utilizing the same brand. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-3824224-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3824224\"><p>One store tells me to fill out the application using Indeed. I did just that and never heard back from them. The other store (which is located in the same town I reside in) only had TWO employees which dropped to ONE employee after the store manager left. When the store manager was there, I heard excuse after excuse on why I haven't been hired yet and when he was gone leaving the roster to ONE employee in that store, nothing got any better. I had to listen about how they lost their district manager to the store manager leaving to store managers aren't responsible for hiring people; but no phone call, no interview, not even one bit of communication from a \"communication company.\" No loyalty whatsoever and no one to talk to about this problem. </p><p>I had T-Mobile's back when it came to pushing their name for almost 15 years and when it came down to working for them, I feel like a heavy door just keeps being slammed in my face over and over. I went back to the store in my town and over a short few days including a weekend, they have managed to hire one new person who was one of the rudest sales associates I have ever seen and talked to. So, the company decides to go with someone else based on experience from what I am hearing and seeing instead of hiring someone brand new or (my personal favorite) bringing in both parties seeing as the entire store only had ONE associate. </p><p>T-Mobile decides to leave one to hang dry and hire the worst kind of sales associate. I do hear a lot of smokescreen talk like what corporate stores and independent stores do and how they are ran differently, which is complete trash, not that it's true or false, but that it is complete trash and a fail-safe. You are given a brand to represent, yet everyone is on a different page. This is why stores are one brand like T-Mobile one day and tomorrow, the same building is an AT&amp;T store. </p><p>Hiring should be done in a process which ALL stores utilize. Also, store managers should be in charge of hiring. Having to go through an extremely busy district or VP manager that would forget their own head if it wasn't attached due to how busy they may be makes for a bad way to fill a store with much needed and good associates. At this point, I am undecided on whether I even want to stay with a company that isn't even willing to at the VERY LEAST speak to me about employment. I completely understand checking on the status of an application, but when I FEEL LIKE I am now harassing the store for a conversation or an interview just to have the store tell me to go to another store in another town and apply there is a problem in itself.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-3824224\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-3824224\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-3824224-btn\">\n",

I told the rep we plan to spend a lot of time at our condo in McCall when my wife quits teaching in June. I specifically asked him about coverage in McCall, and he assured me we would have no problems. After school let out the first week of June, we went and stayed at our condo in McCall. We couldn't make or receive calls from our condo. When we came back to Boise I called T-Mobile and told them we can't use our phones from our condo. The guy on the phone seemed to know they have spotty service, but if I were to switch carriers I would have to pay a $1900 cancellation fee. I told him we'd gladly give them back our phones. Now we're stuck with crappy service for 19 more months, or we face a huge bill. Had they told us up front their service sucks in McCall, we would never have switched.</p></div>, <div class=\"rvw-bd\"><span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">Original review: June 26, 2018</span><p></p><p>I've been a T-Mobile customer for over 5 years and made a mistake of not making payment arrangements and was handed down a terrible $90 late fee for no payment.

It was because my phone was already a year and a half yr old. It passed the warranty. However I took the insurance that way, when something goes wrong they can replace it. Apparently they won’t because I originally got the phone from another carrier. I got passed around so many times (between T-Mobile/Assurant/Apple). There’s even one rep (lady) that she said she will put me on hold to verify info, then she just hanged up. Maybe because she did not want to hear me because I was so frustrated (who wouldn’t)?... can you just imagine how I got more frustrated when she did that.

Very clean, and not fancied-up with a lot of advertisements or promotional material I have to read to see that my payment was received. T-Mobile has provided good customer service, when I've needed it, and that hasn't been often because their product, i.e., system software, is intuitive and dependable.

I live in Phoenix metro not a field In the middle of nowhere despite what the horrible reception would lead one to believe. Boosters did nothing to help. The non-stop “wait another month or two.

I am very naggy about bill payment, never been late in 14 years, but still get a few bill due emails and texts every month. Tried using our free gig of usage, but they claimed we nearly used it all when I only looked at one web page. Now pay for 3 gigs, use it way more, but only 0.5 used?

There are always hidden fees and charges that aren't clear. Usually when you mention this to T-Mobile they waive the charges.

The 1st rep just suspended the 2 lines (even though insisted I wanted it canceled) and offered me a $80 for 4 lines plan and confirmed it was scheduled for next billing cycle. Fast forward to start of next cycle, nothing changed, I called T-Mobile again. This time I was told there is no plan like that and they couldn't do that and that there’s no way the rep promised that. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-3721735-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3721735\"><p>I requested them to go through my recorded call to confirm I wasn’t making stuff up.

He then offered me a $100 for 4 lines and said it would apply next cycle and applied a $20 compensation. And it happened again start of this billing cycle, I spoke to the supervisor too and she said there’s no way they can do it, there’s no such plan. All they could escalate the issue was their personal guarantee that a complaint was made and it would be investigated. No reference number or further details.

Overall, I would definitely recommend T-Mobile. They are the one company I have used that doesn't seem to be trying to screw over customers.

I can understand that presenting a plan with lower costs attracts new customers. However, there is no consideration for consumers that have remained with a company for a long time. T-Mobile, specifically, has an offer of 4 lines for 100 dollars with unlimited voice, text, and data. I have been a customer for about 10 years and still pay about 70 dollars for the same services. Companies need to reward their customers who stay with them by offering lower costs.

No funny fees or anything else. If the signal in your house is weak, ask for the FREE small cell site that connects to you Internet service. Coverage in your home will now be 5 bars! Have used it traveling to Oregon, Montana, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, as well as in Washington and the coverage has been great! As long as you have a GSM phone, all you need from them is two sim chips. If you only have one phone, ask for the two and put the other away for use later. Ensure you ask for a number to be assigned.

I was told after the month was up, the service would continue for another month and my credit card would be charged. After 2 weeks in the hospital, my girlfriend was good to leave. I decided to use the hotspot in my car while at work which was nice for about 2 weeks when it stopped working. Being busy with work as well as at home with a loved one that had a stroke and has cancer, I kind of forgot about the hotspot. </p><p>Honestly, I figured they were still charging me monthly for a device I wasn't using. I knew or thought anyway that it was on me to cancel and I would when I could. I would have rather I had been charged monthly than what happened. I get a letter in the mail from a collection agency stating I owe $37 or so for I guess activation fee. WTF?! I thought that was paid the day I got the thing activated. I basically now paid at least $87 for 1 month of not great internet service. There were days in the hospital where we had no service at all. Did I complain? No. But then to get a letter that basically threatens me with bad credit etc is ridiculous. Did they help me at the store.

Trying to fix few issues with Note8. Some software questions and connection with Samsung Gear VR problem. I was really surprised when first associate said he never heard about Virtual Reality and Samsung gear. So I ask to let me talk to someone who knows. Four people!!! No one knows! I ask them, where you located (heard strong accent)? He said near Manila, Philippines. All four representatives showing no knowledge, providing no help! T-Mobile got so cheap, hiring third parties from third countries, even they raise my bill $70 without clear explanation (still working on it, not easy). T-Mobile used to do phone trouble shooting remotely, people from Philippines saying they don't have this option.

The last plan was supposed to be canceled, AS THEY TOLD ME, but it wasn't! I started with the new plan but they, without notifying me, continued billing for the previous plan!!!

Apart from some bad reception and some glitches here and there I didn't really have any complaints. I was only paying $40 and for that I was happy... Until I wasn't. A friend who was the owner of the account moved to London, so I wanted to take the ownership of the account. Well here is where it all began. We needed to call at least 6 times before they said they are moving me ahead as the owner of the account - but that was not the case. I just had a separate account now and my own plan now with a bill of 75%. We called at least 15 times to try to resolve this but in the end I was just put back into the old family plan with my friend being the owner again - right where we started. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-3643879-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3643879\"><p>So much energy lost...

I've been a T-Mobile customer for about two years and after giving T-Mobile every reasonable opportunity to keep me as a customer I have had enough. On May 5th, 2018 at 7:30 pm I called T-Mobile Customer Support because since October 2017 I have had several issues receiving and placing calls. A massive volume of dropped calls when the communication gets through, and even more problematic the fact that co-workers, relatives and customers calling my wireless number were being taken straight to voice mail; my phone wouldn't even ring as if the incoming calls were never made in the first place.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-3631789-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3631789\"><p>Such terrible service morphed into a chain of problems as you can certainly imagine; co-workers not being able to get in touch with me for work related matters, customers being unable to get a hold of me when they needed it the most, family worried at times because they can't get me to answer the phone just because T-Mobile coverage is increasingly spotty, irritating and getting worst.</p><p>I ordered a Signal Booster by phone so that I can get better coverage at my home (at least). T-Mobile Support shipped the booster after arrangements but being T-Mobile, they shipped it to the wrong address. I received a call from T-Mobile support to \"help me set up a device\" that I hadn't received. The representative noted that the device had been sent to the wrong address, apologized and \"corrected\" the problem by rearranging another device to be sent to the correct address (my current address). That very same day, little after finishing our phone conversation, UPS showed up at my door and delivered the first ordered Booster (the one that had been wrongfully sent to the wrong address). Two days after, I received a second booster since the Support Specialist that assisted me had placed an order for a second device to be shipped to the correct address.</p><p>Next day, I called T-Mobile to let them know that they ended up (due to their issues with the address information) delivering two devices at my home and that I wanted to return the additional one. I was assisted over the phone and received an email with a prepaid UPS mailing label. When one thinks that it can’t get any worst, T-Mobile somehow finds a way to surprise you. </p><p>Today, May 13th 2018, I attempted to deliver T-Mobile’s additional booster; the one that should have never arrived if it wasn’t because T-Mobile couldn’t get the order sent to the right address in the first place but that somehow showed up sometime after ending my phone conversation with their support. Short before 4:00 pm I walked into the T-Mobile store located at 14834 Pines Blvd, Pembroke Pines, FL, 33028. I was greeted and attended after waiting in line like every other customer. I mentioned that I wanted to return a Signal Booster. Since I had never seen what was inside that second box, I asked the employee to open the box and verify that it contained the unopen/unused Signal Booster before sending it back. </p><p>The box was opened there for the first time and everything was in order. I wasn’t even asked for my T-Mobile account, instead I was asked to forward them the email I received from T-Mobile - “Important Instructions for returning your CellSpot device to T-Mobile”. At that point I thought they were going to work off of the information included in that email. To my surprise, they printed out the label, slapped it onto the Signal Booster box and told me to go drop it off at a UPS store. </p><p>It is unclear to me how a store Manager cannot understand T-Mobile’s own guidelines for a return. Since the email clearly reads as follow; and I quote: \"Returning your CellSpot device should be easy, so here are two great options to choose from: Drop the device off at a UPS drop location. Make sure it is securely packaged using the instructions below, and includes the prepaid UPS mailing label provided in the attachment. OR Go to a T‑Mobile® owned or Authorized Dealer Store to return the coverage device. Please remember to return your CellSpot device within the next 30 days so you don't get charged a nonreturn fee of $138.00.\"</p><p>I’m under no obligation to take the device to a UPS store when the instructions clearly state that I can either take it to UPS “OR” go to a T‑Mobile owned or Authorized Dealer Store to return the coverage device. If the instructions hadn’t mentioned two great options to choose from, I wouldn’t have attempted to deliver it to a store in the first place. Well, the T-Mobile store manager instructed an employee to put the UPS label on the box and have me deliver it at a UPS location, even though I was at a T-Mobile Store already, as if I couldn’t have done that myself at home. How they concluded that my reason for visiting the store was to print a shipping label and then drive 10 miles to a UPS store to ship it out, that’s beyond my comprehension.</p><p>I walked out of the store to the parking spaces and call T-Mobile Customer Support from there. I asked to talk to a supervisor but the support representative on the phone kindly “persuaded” me into having her assist me because she was the person in a position to do so – obviously a kind way to prevent you from talking to a supervisor. I explained the situation and asked about the options available to return the Signal Booster. The Customer Support representative was concise in her response: Drop the device off at a UPS drop location. Make sure it is securely packaged using the instructions emailed to me, and include the prepaid UPS mailing label provided in the email I received. OR Go to a T‑Mobile owned or Authorized Dealer Store to return the coverage device.</p><p>Because I was standing right outside the store, I asked her if she could explain this to the store manager and she kindly agreed. I went back into the store and requested to talk to a manager but I had to wait because all managers were busy at the time. Since the Support Representative had been with me on the phone for half hour, she asked if I knew the store address or their phone number to call them directly. I provided this information and she called in.</p><p>Exactly after 38 minutes, she came back to me on the phone and I could hear in her voice that she was heartbroken. She didn’t know how to tell me what she was about to say: “I called the store and I spoke with **. ** can see you are sitting there waiting for a manager but you need to take your package to a UPS location”. I felt bad for her and even worst for myself. T-Mobile’s stores (at least the one I was in) cannot follow T-Mobile’s own guidelines – those provided in written to their own customers. I left the store at about 5:30 pm convinced that I have tried, in good faith, to return the equipment as stated in T-Mobile’s guidelines, by following one of the options provided to me in writing by email. I Twitted to @TMobile and TMobileHelp trying to bring some attention into this matter, giving T-Mobile thirty days to come pick up the device at my doorsteps else I will have it disposed.</p><p>It seems that T-Mobile is unable to come pick up their device at my place and I strongly refuse to attempt to drop it off anywhere once again after having wasted two hours of my Saturday to no avail, as if they owned me, my time and my money, just because T-Mobile’s employees are incapable of following their own business guidelines and instructions. T-Mobile’s attempt to put the burden on its customer is something that I will no longer tolerate. It has caused me to lose work opportunities, missing in the process important customers’ calls and it expects me to drop off their equipment multiple times when they can’t even come to my door for a pick up once.</p><p>On June 12th, exactly 30 days from now, I will dispose the device if it isn’t picked up at my location by T-Mobile. T-Mobile and its Customer Support has all the necessary information to call me for pickup arrangements. I truly hope they don’t also make the mistake of charging my account with late fees for not showing up at my home to pick up a device that should have never made it to my house if they had done one out of ten things right, especially after my attempt to deliver it at their store per their instructions and their refusal to take it in.</p></div><div class=\"rvw-bd-glry js-rvw-bd-glry\" data-target-id=\"3631789\"><div class=\"rvw-bd-glry__img\" data-ca-modal-active-pic=\"1\" data-ca-modal-collection='[{\"src\": \"https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/reviews/t-mobile_240280.png\", \"thumbnail\": \"https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/cache/reviews/t-mobile_240280_thumbnail.jpg\", \"name\": \"\"}, {\"title\": \"T-Mobile\"}]' data-ca-modal-type=\"gallery\" data-more-images=\"0+\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/cache/reviews/t-mobile_240280_thumbnail.jpg\"/></div></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-3631789\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-3631789\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-3631789-btn\">\n",

Twice we submitted the information required for the rebate. Each time we were assured that it is being processed. Today, for the second time, I visited our local T-Mobile store. After approximately an hour of trying to find the reason for the delay, the T-Mobile agent contacted the Reimbursement Department so I could speak to them. First, the agent on the phone informed me that I did not file for a rebate within the 30 day requirement period. I told him that was untrue and, that in fact, I filed twice; the second time an agent at the store filed for me. Then he informed me that I would not be getting the rebate because my I6 and I6+ were not eligible for a rebate. I said we owed nothing on those two phones and was only asking for the rebate for the I7 phone as I was promised.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-3630205-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3630205\"><p>He stated that because the two phones were not eligible then the I7 was also not eligible as they lump the three together.

Worst mistake we ever made! Worst company I have dealt with in my 40 years of business. We used three phones to start with and an unlimited plan was given. Then they said we qualified for up to 41 free Tablets due to our account. So we told them we would only need four.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-3603868-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3603868\"><p>From the very first billing, it was wrong. Then on the second billing, it showed we were paying for the \"free\" tablets. My wife had to go into the store EVERY month so they would remove the charges for the tablets. EVERY MONTH because they tried and tried to remove them but they could not get the corporation to remove them. Finally, after a year and a half of this nonsense, we paid off the phones, returned the Cell Spot we had to have to even get service in our own home! And went with another carrier. </p><p>That was Nov. 26th, 2017. We are still having to deal with these morons because now they say we have a bill not paid but will not send us an itemized statement, just a large amount. They even said we owed for the Cell Spot we returned, even though the T-Mobile Store and telephone support said it showed we returned it and they received it. We have documents do this fact. Now they have turned us over to a collection agency. We explained to them the situation and they were going to mail us an itemized statement... They sent just a bill without being itemized. So, our next step is to take legal action against them I suppose.</p><p>This is the worst, by far, of any company I have ever dealt with.

No human is in control is what the excuse is; equals no choice for the customers.</p><p>It also goes in my history with them; them trying to turn my line off and charging me a contract fee cancellation of $400 which I never tried to cancel and I paid immediately and yet they still didn't want to turn my phone on and in order to do so, they said would have to charge me $10 a month for 2 yrs to allow me back into the system which they denied doing but did; because they added the charge name to it as a device charge and denied ever doing this to me. This is true fraud and I tolerated and was too scared to leave in fear they would do worse to my account for this long, and they have. Still charging me to the end.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-3594499\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-3594499\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-3594499-btn\">\n",

Today I had to call and speak to JD about something I could not figure out. He was very patient; great listener and RESOLVED my issue in a minimal time frame.

After several attempts to have these phones activated, I was told that I would have to go to a Store to have them done. Not having a Store anywhere near me, I called and requested that my account be canceled. The lady on the phone said it was canceled and being that I had only had it for 4 days, I would not be charged. Next thing I know I received a bill for $80. The bill itself shows Equipment $0.00, Service $0.00, You used 0.00 of unlimited data with T-Mobile ONE, ** 0.00mb, ** 0.00mb, 0 minutes of talk and 0 messages. So, What exactly am I paying for??? After I called, they refused to eliminate the bill, they did reduce it to $21.32. I'm thoroughly disgusted that I have to pay ANYTHING!!!

If you live in an area where T-Mobile's cellular reception is good, and you don't do any traveling, then T-Mobile is a good deal. However, if you do any traveling and your travels take you outside metropolitan areas, in our opinion, you should not consider this purveyor. T-Mobile shows their coverage area of the US, in pink and it covers most of the US. One might take that to mean GREAT COVERAGE but don't be fooled! You will get service, a half a bar or less, however the majority of the time, the only benefit you will have is texting. If you are able to call, you must be outside and the connection will be sporadic at best. We personally have experience poor service in both Utah and Colorado. So, we are going back to AT&amp;T Mobility where never had these issues.

I would highly recommend reviewing and comparing carrier charges when you travel international as they definitely don’t have the best rates.

T-Mobile’s coverage is AWFUL. We were with them for about 6 months. We live in a heavily populated area. My husband is a truck driver. We bought brand new Samsung phones from T-Mobile so our problems couldn’t be blamed on the phones. We had COUNTLESS calls dropped. Important calls, from doctors, from all of our friends and family. And my husband on the road? He would be staring right at a cell tower and couldn’t make a call.

I called T-Mobile and they said “Let me refresh the network.” That didn’t work. Nothing worked. I do want to say that the customer service representatives were great. They give great customer service. It’s the product that is defective, not the customer service. No amount of customer service can make up for the amount of troubles that we went through with T-Mobile. It cost us a fortune to pay off the phones we bought on a payment plan with T-Mobile. Since those phones weren’t compatible with our new carrier, we had to eat that money. It was a very expensive lesson.

I was actually encouraged to do this to save money and go green. My bills were paid with no outstanding issues. About 6 months ago we decided to switch to MetroPCS for their family plan and our phone option needs. It seemed pretty straightforward -- port the number, clear any outstanding bills, and move forward with life. Fast forward 6 months and my credit rating has dropped significantly from one month to the next and as I dig through this discover that T-mobile has sent something to collections.

No luck. Locked out with a customer service number to call. So next I got to spend lots of time with customer service who could not give me any indication of the bill, send me a copy of it, or otherwise explain what was happening. I will give some praise to the supervisor of the call center who apologized profusely for not being able to help me and herself confused about how this happened and why this had progressed to this stage without notice. But her \"hands were tied\". Made me go to the store with my ID to have them figure it out. They were confused why I needed to be there. They then have to call the customer service themselves explaining to me that they really do not handle this stuff.</p><p>They give me the \"bill\" that has a summary charge of $116.54 with no detail what the amount represents or how the got to that sum. It is literally just a total with no explanation. They then hand me some other number to call without indicating who I was calling (just said this is who you have to call). So I call that number to be told that I now have to call a lawyer's office to clear up the matter. The person on this call was abrupt, rude, and unwilling to give me any additional information about what was happening. Are you kidding me? All this for a relatively small bill that I have never seen? This after 10+ years of being a customer and paying all bills?</p><p>Now I deal with the lawyer's office -- the first entity that can actually send me the bill in question. The bill was for $54 for the month after the account was closed. She explained in the fine print of the terms and agreement, I was NOT to get my bill electronically anymore and that is why I was not notified the same way for this bill as I had been all the years before. So even though I paid what I thought was due at the time of porting and tried to clear all remaining items, this original bill for $54 now became $ 116.54. What were the other charges? I don't know because I still have not seen the bill.</p><p>This entire drama wasted the time of an entire string of people all because they could not electronically send me the final bill as they had been for years? The cost of \"collecting\" this fees is orders greater than a single text alert or final bill reminder ever could!! From my perspective the practices are unfair and the impact to a person too high for this to be a responsible way of doing business.

When I asked to speak to a supervisor it took quite a bit of time until \"Alen\" got on the line who said he could expedite the time to unlock to 24 hrs - okay then restore T-MOBILE service for 24 hours so we can at least take care of business and be safe - surprise! </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-3505843-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3505843\"><p>It takes 24-72 hours to do that!

But summarizing, I will say that they charged me $100.00 more than what they had originally told me. And I still pay every month on time, because I'm a person that hates to be late on any bill. Then, a year later they told me they were sorry and they will reduce my payment to the original amount. They only did it for one month and went back to overcharge me. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-3500941-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3500941\"><p>In December of 2017, they offered me a promotion they had in because I was NEVER late in my payments in all the years I was with them, I accepted and got a buy one get one free iPhone 8 to give it to my son for Christmas. After I gave it to my son as a present, I called to activate the phone and T-mobile told me they were not going to honor that offer because someone made a mistake and I if I kept the phones I was going to pay $750.00. I had no choice, but to tell my son I had to take the phones back. After that, I finally decided to cancel my account and change to a different company.</p><p>Well, T-mobile has managed to make the transition another nightmare. Instead of just transferring my phones and sending my final bill. T-mobile refused to unlock my daughter's phone (which was not their phone because I had paid cash for it), and they refused to tell my daughter what to do to be able to use it with the other company. My daughter is in Hawaii in college and was without a phone for more than a week because of T-mobile's refusal to unlock the phone.</p><p>I called T-mobile MULTIPLE TIMES, to ask why they had locked the phone if I did not owe anything on it. I also asked them to tell me if I had to pay the last bill I will pay it. They kept telling me, I did not have to pay, but at the same time, they kept sending emails stating that, they will not unlock the phone unless I paid what I owed.</p><p>I finally called for the 30th time desperate because I could not communicate with my daughter and they finally took my payment and my daughter got the email with instructions to use her phone. I begged them to check to make sure they had my correct address, to make sure I received my final bill to pay it and send it to the new company. They assured me they had my correct address.</p><p>All this happened in January and February, and here we are in APRIL and I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED my final bill. I've called several times to let them know I'm still waiting for that bill. I know they have my correct address because I am receiving their harassing letters of nonpayment threatening to send me to collections for not paying and yet, they still have not sent me my final bill. So, how I’m I supposed to know what my balance is, if I don’t have my final bill???? </p><p>I called them twice in the last three days to ask for my final bill again and again. I called again to paid my balance and the only reason I knew what my balance was it was because I received another non-payment letter YESTERDAY showing me the amount I owe, and they have gigantic THIS IS YOUR FINAL NOTICE title, how stupid is that title when this is the first document I see what my final balance is. When I called to pay it, I ask the woman to email me a receipt and my final bill and she told me. ”I'm sorry, but I'm not going to send you a receipt or your final bill because your account is closed and I can't do anything to help you.” This is the kind of service I received from this company.

Each and every time you call, even to pay a bill a recording comes on that someone will be on the call in an estimated 20 minutes and it's often longer. There are inefficiencies with this provider from long hold times to reach customer service each and every time, to representatives who are in most cases (there are exceptions) unhelpful and the service is just not good. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-3493543-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3493543\"><p>I would recommend Verizon, AT&amp;T or probably most any other service may very well provide better service.

Whenever I touched that \"home\" button a pop up would ask me to choose my default home choice either \"Home\" or \"Quick Home\" or some kind of simplified \"Home\" setting. So foolishly I walked into the T-mobile store at 6970 E 22nd Street Ste. 120 In Tucson Arizona 85710. I told the salesperson that I needed a \"Warranty Replacement\" in no uncertain terms. I also informed him that I did not want to finance another phone and considering I had been paying the insurance and their JUMP (Just Upgrade My Phone) on my paid for K7 for at least 3 years having been with T-mobile for over 8 years total.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-3487840-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3487840\"><p>I apparently had completely blocked out what had happened several years back which had caused me to have the K7 in the first place, but little did I know I was about to revisit T-mobile's deceptive sales practices AGAIN. After telling the guy what I wanted I also stressed the fact that I didn't want my phone bill to go up even one dollar... I thought this would deter this guy from forcing a new phone finance on me. I left that store with my K7 and a new K20 and the promise that my monthly bill was not going to increase but only for 2 dollars and these 2 devices that I wasn't even sure what they did. It wasn't until I got my bill when I saw that not only did I have 2 new lines of service but I was also stuck with these 140 dollars in devices that won't work on my year of vehicle.</p><p>And true to his word... I wasn't financing a new phone. Apparently I was now LEASING a phone from T-mobile. Within 12 hours I was on the phone with Customer Service in tears because I had been taken AGAIN by their outright lies. At first Cari in Customer Service seemed a Godsend. They assured us that we wouldn't be charged any restocking fee and that the phone could go back under their \"Buyer's Remorse\" plan but they insisted that I could hold on to the K20 until I got my replacement. They were going to report the store for its sales practices and they would send me my warranty replacement for my K7 ASAP. So between the time I speak with Customer Service and the time they send a new phone, the phone that I was to send back to T-mobile the K7 was stolen from my car.</p><p>Now I use my phone for work doing delivery so to be without a phone would cost me money. Tonya a T-mobile rep told me to just put the replacement phone back in the box and use the K20 until I got back my K7. So I send the K7 back to them. In the interim I tried several times to pay online their 20 dollar deductible. Finally when I did get through a computer automated voice told me that a claim had already been made and hung up. So I'm not getting anything in the mail as far as phones so I call AGAIN. This time and for the hundredth time I told them what happened. No one ever mentioned to me that I had to return the K20 within a certain amount of time. They only assured me that I could use it to work until my K7 came.</p><p>So FINALLY I'm able to pay the deductible... but what do they send me? A K20. And NO ONE can tell me where my K7 is. Also they're saying that not only am I stuck with this phone the K20 I'm also stuck with these 2 WiFi devices that won't even work on my year of vehicle. Having a cell phone is a luxury to people like me who live hand to mouth. When a company you have been paying 100 dollars a month for the past 8 years thinks it's okay to defraud you like this then its time for me to speak out about this abuse.

It really makes me mad when a corporation says \"I am sorry we can't honor that,\" and chooses to make the customer pay for its mistake. We are only talking a few hundred dollars in insurance credit, but the store manager refused to take of the customer, me. Now I was raised when you tell a customer something you honor it. If you make a mistake, you eat it. It's called the price of doing business. I am not a new customer to T-Mobile and have had some dealings with some dealings with good customer representatives over the years.

Joe the manager convinced me since I do Rideshare for a living I should purchase a sync up drive for wi-fi in my vehicle to slow down my everyday data usage. It never made a difference and the price he quoted me would always be lower than I was billed for. This caused me to come back continuously to see what the problem was. I added storage for a dollar a month, just in case that might be a problem. Joe continuously strung me along telling me that the sync up drive would be cheaper because we added my business discount to my son's T-Mobile account and that would offset the price. He kept trying to convince me that it was best to keep my sync up because if I dropped it it would affect the price and discount on my son's phone account. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-3439600-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3439600\"><p>One day I told him that I wanted to drop the sync up but I did not want it to affect his commission for the sync up sale. He stated that he will put it in his notes that if I keep it for 2 more months he would reimburse me for it. He also stated that he will check into unlimited data for me and give me a call. 2 weeks went by and he never called. I decided that I needed unlimited data. I told my son to go to T-Mobile with me to do this but I wanted to do this because I still trusted him and thought he was looking out for my best interests. Joe hooked us up with the unlimited data but told me that the sync up which is in my name would affect this account if I dropped it. I have to pay the difference for the extra data so that is why I wanted to drop the sync up because it was not doing anything for me and I felt I was wasting money. </p><p>I received another bill after this that. Joe stated it would be $5.00 Cheaper for direct depositing my payment and it was still the same. I called him about it and he said he would look into it and call me back, which never materialized. That's when I knew I was really being taken for a ride. I went to another T-Mobile at Great Northern in North Olmsted and found out that Joe was being deceiving from the beginning. He should not have been going into my son's account because I was not an authorized user, in the first place. My son's account has nothing to do with my account. Joe has tech. ability but uses it to make sales and takes advantage of people with less knowledge. I don't appreciate that in the least bit. </p><p>I dropped the sync up and also found out that the store Joe is at is not a corporate store. All the time I was going there I thought it was. I will never step foot in there again. I advise all shoppers for their own protection to just deal with corporate run stores. The 3rd party stores are more sales hungry and will take you for a ride. I also would like to mention to T-Mobile that people you have running your stores like Joe have, are, and will continue to tarnish your reputation if you continue to let acts like this to continue.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-3439600\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-3439600\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-3439600-btn\">\n",

The reason was a coverage issue. We have relatives in DUMAS, TX, where we have to go to the edge of town to make calls. At home in CA we needed a Cellspot to make calls at home (Calls usually drop during handover outside the house). Immediately upon the porting of our numbers I received an email requesting the return of the Cellspot repeater from T-mobile. Every month my bill was around $ 180. Suddenly I received a bill for $ 286.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-3432274-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3432274\"><p>Hence, on March 10, I called to inquire about the reason for this. I could not understand the first person (India?) and requested to speak to a supervisor. She (the supervisor) informed me that I still had 1 line active with T-mobile. I told her that this is impossible and to cancel that line, as it is not used by me or my family. She confirmed that she would do that retroactively and put me on hold. Instead of getting back to me, I again got an un-understandable person. I hung up and called again after the weekend on March 13. Spoke to a friendly person named Kevin. I explained again that I had no knowledge of this additional line and that I do not even know that number and do not have a sim card for this, and hence will absolutely not pay $ 100 for a service that I never received. He offered me a $15 reduction, which I refused. This is not about the money. This is about not wanting to get screwed over.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-3432274\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-3432274\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-3432274-btn\">\n",

I call in, 1 hour and 6 reps later they credit my account and cancel. I have never dealt with such a fragmented customer service department, maybe other than Comcast. They sent me from person to person with each person doing one small step. I had to explain my situation to each person and give my account number, etc. Ultimately I only needed someone to credit the account and close my account for good.

In Nov 2016 I added my brother and his wife to a family plan that was I pay for 2 lines and the other 2 lines on them. The transition was difficult and for the 17 months now I have called in 1-2 times a month. At the end of every conversation I am assured that all would be well. Today I called and decided to hear what my rate plan was. Basically what I read on the internet of what my plan was supposed to be was different than what the automated service said.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-3422521-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3422521\"><p>So I spoke to the customer retention dept who informed me that I had been on the family plan but that at some point I cancelled one of the lines.

I was told that the supervisor would be personally seeing to it that I was back on the family plan. I have little faith in T-Mobile and every month it dwindles even more.

When I relocated I noticed that the quality of service was horrible. No signal in my home at all (had to use WiFi) and unable to use the phone outside my home until I was closer to the highway. I continued to call T-Mobile and was advised that there were towers scheduled for my area. So I stayed and dealt with it. I had 5 lines in total. After constant calls, complaints, aggravating days, booster boxes were sent that didn’t help. Almost a year later I finally decided to look into another carrier. I switched all the lines to a new service provider and with the change, I traded all the phones for new ones and the new carrier gave me credit and/or Visa gift cards with an amount that the phones were worth.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-3421255-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3421255\"><p>Now, two of the phones were such a huge decrease in value I was embarrassed. Here’s why. My husband upgraded to an iPhone 7plus and the phone was snatched out of his hand one day and dropped, causing the screen to shatter. T-Mobile directed me to Asurion and with a $150 deductible, he received another phone- a refurbished one. What had me upset with that transaction was the deductible was not subtracted from the amount still owed for the phone he had prior that was broken and we still had to continue to pay for that phone, which we no longer had. When switching to the new carrier, the phone wasn’t worth as much because it was refurbished and the gift card amount was $37! But T-Mobile charged me over $400 with the final bill sent to me. Plus, one of the lines they didn’t cancel. The line remained open and then went into suspension for nonpayment. </p><p>Now during this time (from September through November) I would continue to call and ask them about the final bill (why I hadn't received it) and when will I see the charges for the service that I had to pay for. Well, I was told so many stories from, the service is in non-payment status so you have to pay the past due amount, restore the service and then request a cancellation (why when I ported the numbers?). Then I was told since I was a customer who opted out of paper bills years prior, I wouldn’t get one and would have to log into my account online in order to see the bill and pay it (well I can’t do that because when the numbers were ported, the online access was terminated). Then I was told I would get a bill but it would take about 2 months because the lines had to be taken out of suspension for nonpayment, then cancelled correctly. </p><p>So the supervisor that I was speaking with at that time couldn’t do it because he was not in customer service. So he wanted me to pay for the service to have it reinstated, then transfer me to customer service so someone in that department could cancel it. \"Well, Anthony (that was his name), why am I required to pay for services hag I didn’t use? I don’t understand why I should pay for service after 9/28 when my lines were ported to another carrier on 9/28. It’s not my fault that your company didn’t do their part.\" He continued to tell me that’s the only way to fix the error. When I asked him why the service charges couldn’t be credited, he explained he was in a department where he could only accept payments, not resolve issues like mine and issue credits but he would note the account and get me to the correct department and to a supervisor. </p><p>Well he didn’t do either. Mind you, he was the 3rd person I spoke with that day and the 7th person I spoke with in total. When he transferred the call, no notes from him so I had to explain the entire situation again. It became frustrating. Finally a representative (while waiting for her supervisor) went through all the previous notes and did the calculations after seeing the errors and said she would issue the credits and give the “system” 10-21 days to send the final bill. So I waited. Now let me also mention that the booster boxes I received needed to be returned. The first supervisor I spoke with explained she would send me the boxes and return mailed but there’s also instructions on how to return them to a T-Mobile store if there was one close. Well, the store is in the same strip mall as the new carrier I changed to. </p><p>So I went to the store, my Husband and my Dad took the boxes, boosters and paperwork into the store that clearly stated the store would take the equipment. The salesman in the store stated that was the wrong procedure. But the T-Mobile document states this is an option. He stated it was wrong and he was the manager. After a few minutes of reading the paperwork (which included the steps that he would need to take), he admitted he didn’t know how to do it and since the account was closed, he didn’t know what to do. So we had to take it to UPS or the post office. Well, now over four months later, I get a final bill and a letter from a collection agency on the same day! The issue now is that the service was credited BUT, the charges for two of the phones that were refurbished are significantly higher than what the new carrier gave me for the phones. </p><p>Now, I don’t mind paying for the service and maybe a little for the phones, but one phone was over $400 charged by T-Mobile the new carrier gave me $37! That’s ridiculous. So when I spoke with the first collection agency rep I couldn’t pay for the phones because the Visa cards were in my Husband’s name and he was working. So I told the representative that we were leaving out the next morning to travel for a funeral and if I didn’t call back that evening, I’d call when I returned home. He was fine with that but I went ahead and paid for the service charges. We calculated them together but his amount totaled lower than mine, so I paid my amounts anyway. When I called back and paid for the phone charges that the new carrier gave me Visa gift cards for and the $37 (totaling $500 for 3 phones) the representative then became rude and told me I had to pay the remaining amount. </p><p>I explained to him that I wanted to dispute that because it was for phone charges for phones that were not new, I didn’t have any longer and we’re charged way too much. Now he said he’d do so but when I tell you his attitude totally changed it was like night and day. I was shocked and I told him that not only was he combative and rude but he was interrupting me and getting loud and I was not happy with how the conversation changed so quickly and I’m too much of a fragile state to have my buttons pushed. It seemed to me that he was saying things deliberately to try and get me upset &amp; argue, which I was not going to do. I was dealing with the death of a close family member, 10 hours worth of traffic and although I was tired and it was late, I made sure I honored my end of the deal and called to make the payment for the $500.</p><p>Now I’m waiting to see what happens when the disputed charges are sent back to T-Mobile. I’m not paying for phones that were not worth what they’re charging. I think this is bogus and wrong business practices. Plus I failed to mention that the fee for the insurance that we had on the lines was not prorated. So even though I switched my service on the billing cycle date, not only did I pay for the current month, I had to pay for insurance for the next month as well. I’m paying insurance for a phone that I don’t have anymore? Really T-Mobile? </p><p>Now let me say, I’m paying more per month for the service with the new carrier. But that’s fine because my phone works everywhere. And I’m handicap so having a phone that works is a peace of mind that I don’t mind paying more for. My husband travels for work and has no issues; my parents always have service, which is great. My daughter also has service on the neighborhood and at school so I can always reach her. T-Mobile has horrible business practices.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-3421255\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-3421255\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-3421255-btn\">\n",

T-Mobile's SyncUp Drive car router. It is defective DEVICE and T-Mobile charges much more for the device and the service than what you may be told about at the store. When I installed it in my 2017 Honda Pilot, it caused multiple error codes on a brand new Honda. I took it to the dealership (on a trip) to clear the codes. After arriving home, more error codes and the service department where I bought the Honda told me the device caused the errors, had blown a fuse and should be removed. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-3378655-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3378655\"><p>I didn't notice until several months later that I was being charged $12/mo for the device and a line for the service. The T-Mobile salesman charged me $26 originally for the SyncUp Drive but didn't tell me that they would charge me $2/mo for 24 mo plus $10/mo for an extra line for the device. When I called the support line they told me that I should have noticed the unexpected charges and only took off on month's charges.

On my way to work, I will call my wife to talk to her while she is at work. On the way, I would drop the phone call at least 3 to 4 times. It wasn't uncommon for me to drop phone calls 8-10 times a day. That was just my line alone. If you include my wife's phone and my children, we would drop at least 25 calls a day. It was terrible and I only had the service for a month. I asked to be relieved of my service and return the phones. I was required to still pay for the phones and was not let out of it. I still canceled my service and had to pay for the phones which cost me a couple thousand dollars. My only advice is to stay away.

Their billing is in 30 increments meaning your bill date changes from month to month and you effectively pay 13 times per year for service. When the high speed runs out you are barely able to check your email unless you have 2-3 minutes per email that you can devote. Connections drop and sometimes lag even when there is high speed data left. I could go on and probably use all 50,000 words, but I think there is enough here to refer anyone to another company.

Don’t believe that their unlimited plans will give you unlimited 4G speed. If you upgrade to Plus 1, for another $10/month, after 10 GB your unlimited 4G becomes 3G. ie Limited. If you join their Plus 1 at an additional $25/month, unlimited means that after 50MB, you are bumped to the end of their users and slower 3G. In other words, ‘unlimited’ becomes limited even for your upcharges. I’ve always thought the definition of ‘unlimited‘ meant ‘without limits’. Not to T-Mobile!</p></div>, <div class=\"rvw-bd\"><span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">Original review: Feb. 19, 2018</span><p></p><p>We switched from our previous longtime mobile phone service provider because T-Mobile had a program for unlimited phone, text and data for 2 users that was to be half the cost of our previous carrier (Verizon). We signed up on December 9, 2017. We immediately had dropped calls and areas of no service here in the Leesburg and Tavares Florida area. After repeated problems we decided we could not live with that unreliable service so we switched back to our previous provider on December 14, 2017. They have billed us $88.33 for the 6 days because they are charging for a full month past the time of the discontinuance of our service, or nearly a month and a half. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-3347563-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3347563\"><p>We did not call them because it should not be necessary to make calls to get them to provide the service they contracted to provide us. They are claiming that it is our responsibility to contact them and inform them of the problem so they can try to fix it. I stated if that is so then it is just as much their responsibility to contact me to check and see if I am receiving their service and getting what they are billing me for, which of course did not happen. They refuse to agree to any adjustment and of course, they wield all the power to report it to the credit bureau and negatively impact our credit rating. We have the option of formal dispute thru arbitration as per their contract terms but that costs $200.00 to the consumer which is not practical for an $88.33 charge, of which I would have no problem settling for $35.00. </p><p>I just want to warn people of their one-sided practices and their process to shaft the average user while they do not live up to their end of the contract. So BUYER BEWARE before starting anything new with T-Mobile. We have gone back to Verizon at about twice the cost but we have never had a dropped call or area of no service in those same places in Leesburg and Tavares Florida.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-3347563\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-3347563\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-3347563-btn\">\n",

Their Communication as a company is horrible. I been dealing with them for almost 8 days. My account was overcharge which cause me issue financially. They stated they were going to resolve the matter within 3 business day which it has been 8 days and the situation has not been taken care. I feel customer service yes you to death just to get you off the phone and nothing get resolve. Will not recommend anyone to T-Mobile. Will give them to tomorrow to get the matter resolve.

I left T-Mobile because I have numerous problems with them and they act as if they don't care. Every time you make a change it’s an issue and they come up with some kind of extra fees for you to pay. One in customer service knows anything. Then the manager had the nerve to tell me, “WHAT IS IT THAT YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND.” What kind of service is that? I was trying to explain to them that I was told when I turned in my phone I paid my bill and was told that I didn't owe anything else. I received a bill in the mail for $184.23 in the mail. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-3253012-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3253012\"><p>I spoke to 3 different people the first day and the last person that I spoke with told me that I did not owe anything and that the balance for my bill was zero. I received another bill for $184.23 in the mail today and now they are trying to tell me I owe the bill. I asked if all calls were recorded and they told me yes and placed me on a brief hold and amazingly the only part of the call they had was with the first person that I talked to. There is no way that he listened to that entire call because I was on the phone with them for a very long period of time. And then he proceeded to tell me that the only reason that I previously called was to cancel my service. That let me know that he lied about listening to that call because the service was cancelled when I switched over to AT&amp;T. </p><p>The phone service at T-Mobile is just ok. The internet service on their cellphones is awful. The customer service is the worst. Their people in customer service are beyond rude and very unhelpful. I feel as if they are trained to avoid problems and not to solve them. I would never recommend for anyone to go to T-Mobile. This has been the worst experience that I have ever had with any cellphone provider. And on top of all of that I have been on hold for over an hour.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-3253012\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-3253012\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-3253012-btn\">\n",

I was visiting Canada and my internet speed was less than 2G, I spent nearly 10 days calling customer service, they opened a trouble ticket # ** to try to figure out the problem. After 10 days during my vacation in Canada and nearly 5 hours of wait times, I was simply told, \"Sorry you have a max 5 GIG in Canada!\" So you spend 10 days wasting my time until I found a customer service rep who told me the truth. They all knew the answer but never told me so they don't have to deal with an upset client. After the honest tech girl told me that, I insisted I get a courtesy month so she transferred me to customer service. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-3248635-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3248635\"><p>The first rep refused to do a thing for me and would not put me through to a supervisor. I finally told him I am recording the call and I insist on speaking to a supervisor, so he transferred me. I told him that if he hangs up on me, this will be posted online. Finally the condescending supervisor gets on the phone with me and pretends he can't hear me. I told him that it is an obvious tactic a child plays to avoid responsibility, and all of a suddenly he can hear me! I was polite and very Frank, I explained I was on vacation in Canada, was on an $80.00 unlimited data plan and I expected that and needed that on my vacation, I have been a loyal customer for 8 years and I would leave T-Mobile if they didn't try to make it right. </p><p>He argued with me saying the plan hasn't changed, really, going from unlimited data to 5G is not a change??? I gave him an opportunity to try to make it right or I will leave T-Mobile, he said in a condescending way, \"I can't do a thing for you, thank you for being a T-Mobile customer\" in a ** way, I just hung up. This is how customer service treats a customer of 8 years! I will pay more to a company that offers better customer service than call centers in India who do everything, as I'm sure they are taught, to deflect responsibility or gratuity to the customer.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-3248635\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-3248635\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-3248635-btn\">\n",

If T-Mobile can't get their act together in a major city, God help people that have them away from the city. It may be the iPhone X, but I doubt it as other T-Mobile users I know in New Orleans with iPhones report the same lousy coverage. I have zero intention of renewing with them, even though they are half the cost of other carriers.

T-Mobile offered to let us keep our phones, they'd pay them off, and we'd move to T-mobile. Turns out that what they meant was that we could send our phones to them and, after a few weeks of paying for their cheap phones, they would send new iPhone 7's to us. I found this out and - before we started with them, I cancelled the order and sent back the unused cheap phones. But - we owe them $160.50 for nothing. We call every month when we receive a bill - they say they'll look into it, a month late we get another bill. I suspect our credit is ruined.

Don't bother going on road trips if you want to try to use maps on your cell phone. We tried cancelling and they have continued charging us even when we were with Verizon for 2 months.

On top of that, I had to get one of their \"cell spot\" units because they had no service at my home and this unit was supposed to boost the signal. The device barely boosted the signal at all and basically did not work. After leaving for another carrier, I closed out the account, having paid every dollar owed. When I received something in the mail from T-Mobile after this, I assumed it would be my credit on the account. Instead, it was a bill for nearly $300. It turns out they were charging me $300 for non-return of the cell spot unit that did not work in the first place.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-3233107-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3233107\"><p>As it turns out, enough time passed that I had not realized I owed for this unit, thinking I had purchased it instead. Because it did not work, I discarded it. I called to explain and spoke with a supervisor at T-Mobile, indicating I'm fine paying a reasonable \"I am stupid\" charge for my mistake, but did not feel that I should owe the entire $300 when it certainly did not cost T-Mobile that much. I also reminded her of the unit did not work. $300 under the circumstances is a \"we do not want to work with you\" full retail, \"go away\" price. All of this was to no avail and nothing was offered but unyielding policy. I guess they didn't consider what they would end up losing in reputation and return customers. I figure that far exceeds the $300 they rigidly insisted upon... In addition to this, I was able to find half the unit which I turned in, but T-Mobile refused to honor any refund (even partial)...</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-3233107\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-3233107\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-3233107-btn\">\n",

So, I did.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-3191527-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3191527\"><p>As a victim of identity theft, there were numerous accounts opened under my name. One merchant is requesting a written statement from T-Mobile to support that there has been a fraudulent activity with my account. They are claiming that they spoke to me and confirm the charges on the phone regardless that I told them that my calls were illegitimately forwarded to another number at that time. Contacted T-Mobile to request this written statement. Spoke to an agent and was told that she will call me back with information. Made follow up calls a day and two days later, but was told to wait for the call. Three days later someone called and told me that they cannot provide a written statement regarding the fraudulent activity but they can only verbally state that they see the forwarding call change and my numerous calls about the issue. An email cannot even be sent describing the events or calls made about the account. </p><p>I was told all information are electronically made and cannot be sent. The account holder cannot get information regarding their own account but another person impersonating to be the account holder can make changes on the account?? In the first place, if all agents know how to troubleshoot issues and offered the second layer of protection like creating a password, unauthorized access to accounts could have been prevented. During my repeated calls about the issue, it seems like I have to retell the whole story all over again. Inquired if there are any notes written since it is for the same account. But when you are talking to an agent they keep saying \"it's noted\", where? Who knows? Very frustrating since I am a customer for more than a decade. Not surprising to read poor reviews about T-Mobile online. Bump up the efficiency of your service!</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-3191527\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-3191527\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-3191527-btn\">\n",

To make a call, we had to stand out in the middle of the driveway, even in the rain. After literally 60 calls to customer service, a technician told us we should never have been allowed to subscribe since T-Mobile did NOT provide reliable service at our address. All equipment was returned and then it got even worse. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-3190468-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3190468\"><p>T-Mobile began billing us hundreds of dollars for the equipment that they said they never got. Fortunately, we had the tracking numbers and a month or so later, we got an email from T-Mobile saying that they had conducted an investigation and found that the equipment had in fact been returned. All done, right? No. Bills started coming again. So we sent them a letter explaining the situation. We got no response whatsoever but instead were put in collections with the agency adding it to our credit report. So, if you're trying to decide on a cellular carrier, remember my story. NEVER T-MOBILE. I'd rather use two tin cans and a string to communicate than ever recommend T-Mobile.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-3190468\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-3190468\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-3190468-btn\">\n",

The coverage in the US is spotty. Outside US you get only 2g speeds, very slow. Their website glitches and requires you to sign in multiple times. You can't easily view your detailed bill - it is like a hidden treasure they don't want you to see. It glitches all the time trying to download a pdf of your bill, and often it is not even possible.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-3166000-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3166000\"><p>Customer service is very polite and friendly, but they sometimes miss the calls (outside US) you inquired about getting credit for, and then you end up calling them again and again. Finally, when crossing countries in Europe, their technical side lags behind and their towers do not recognize that you have crossed the border. As the result you are charged $3 per minute vs 20 cents, and have to constantly call the customer service to get this reversed. Glitches and glitches, why can't someone just fix their tech side? Also, good luck getting help from local T-Mobile stores when traveling, esp. abroad - they carry its name, but they have no idea how to fix your network or other problems.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-3166000\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-3166000\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-3166000-btn\">\n",

It went and Mitch seemed to be very knowledgeable and caring about the customers. Then I started using my phones. My phone coverage was not that great. When I got the phones he informed me and showed me on his computer the service coverage was very good in NYS and the Mohawk Valley. However, I found out there were some spots in Ilion where the phone doesn't pick up and also I get disconnected at times when driving in areas near the Thruway. For example, driving on Rte 5S I lose service from Utica to Frankfort sometimes. It's great on the Thruway but you would think coverage would be much better even near it. Very disappointed by the sellers and T-Mobile service on what they express when it comes to coverage. I had Verizon and they had MUCH BETTER coverage.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-3159589-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3159589\"><p>Then the store manager said we would get two free tablets for purchasing their services and the iPhones. This sounded great but it was another lie. The tablets cost $25.00 each I found out. Then they informed me I had to sign an agreement given to me from T-Mobile to my email saying I would be getting the tablets. However, when you go to sign the agreement it states you will owe them $288.00. Therefore, I never signed the agreement. Since I will not sign the agreement they will not give me my tablets. The manager tried to tell me that the tablet would not cost me $288 because on my monthly bill the charge would be canceled out. This doesn't make sense. If T-Mobile wants to give out free stuff then give it out rather than lie about it. What a scam! I do not recommend T-Mobile. They may be a little cheaper than Verizon but if you want to put up with poor services and lies then be my guest.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-3159589\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-3159589\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-3159589-btn\">\n",

Recently my fiancé purchased the iPhone 8 and returned his old iPhone. I received a text stating that we would be getting a credit on our bill. For the next two billing cycles I received bills stating not to pay due to the credit. Today I get a text that I owe $885.50 by January 11. Imagine my surprise. So I call to ask how in the world my $230 monthly bill is $885.50. The representative proceeds to tell me that T-Mobile made a mistake with my credit and is now TAKING IT BACK. Therefore I owe them the money. It took them two entire months to realize their mistake.

This would be an extra $98 a month added onto my $230 bill monthly. I continued to protest that I should not have to pay for their mistake. I have paid my bill on time for 8 years. Never had service suspended due to late payment. But because of their mistake I am being punished two months after the fact. I now have to bring a majority of my daughter's Christmas presents back to the store so that I can afford to pay this bill on top of my student loan, rent, car, food, and many other bills.

Well, on the 5th of each month, I begin receiving text messages saying how \"Your T-Mobile bill is now ready.\" OK...THEN, after about a year's service, I start getting bills that I don't understand. Each month, my bill began INCREASING by $20, FOR NO GOOD DAMN REASON! I called CS, after the 3rd month of this B'S. NO ONE could explain to me why there was an increase! I became so irate, that the CS rep I was speaking to, assured me that my bill would reflect a \"CAP\" and would no longer have charges above and beyond the $147 +change that I was normally paying... OK... So why did I incur these mystery charges in the first place?

I don't think I'll make 9 MORE months, TBH!</p><p>So, I call to defer a payment, the automated system chooses Nov 12th for a small amount, Nov 13, for the remainder. I call on November 8th to pay it off, the system, tried to charge me $296!!! My deferred bill + late fee AND THE NEXT BILL, NOT EVEN DUE UNTIL NOVEMBER 22! To top it off, I had speak to a live advisor, because the automated system wouldn't adjust the charges AND THEY CHARGED ME $6 EXTRA BUCKS to communicate with a HUMAN BEING, which is the one capable of changing the INCORRECT charges! </p><p>I don't expect perfection in all areas of business. There will be issues! But, how do you openly harass customers over bills that aren't even due, FOR THREE WEEKS! Then, have enough nerve to send sales alerts about new models that I can't even trade this piece of crap in for?!

I have been a customer since 2011. After getting the phone, I transferred my data and set it up and all was fine. After a couple days I noticed the phone was acting erratic and apps would open on their own and the unit would start calling people in my recent call list and would not allow me to control the screen or the apps including writing text on its own - gibberish, of course. I called T-Mobile and complained. It was a random problem that would happen and then stop. Seems something is wrong with the screen but I could not seem to get the issue across to the rep. I decided to go into the store. I arrived with phone in hand and met with a young man who looked at the phone updated the software and it seemed fine. I explained the situation and we waited around for it to start acting up. It never did, so I left and said I would be back.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-3105506-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3105506\"><p>The phone once again started to act up in the middle of the night... calling people at random on my recent list - embarrassing. It still does this and I have to shut it off to keep it from taking over. To make a long story short, I have not been able to take it to the store to show them the problem and they never said they would do anything until they could see the issue. Long after the 90 days warranty, I have decided to switch to Sprint who sent me a new iPhone X for a new line and package and tried to give T-Mobile one last chance to make this right and last night they pretty much told me I am stuck with this phone. Sprint is going to pay off the $475 for the piece of junk. But I am really unhappy about how they dealt with me. They should have had someone who could speak English first of all. The reps on the phone had no clue what I was trying to explain.</p><p>Second, they should have just sent a replacement phone without making me prove the issue. Third, they could have, on this last attempt, simply given me the same deal as Sprint, but they treat new customers like Gold but their existing ones like crap when an example like this surfaces. Does not make any sense to me at all. I am closing my account next week and while I like the basic costs and so forth, their customer service is terrible and they do not stand behind the products they peddle.

T-mobile likes to play games with their \"billing due date\" process, which is noticeable when a customer enters their on-line site to pay an amount past due. T-Mobile will identify a \"past due\" amount, which may be accurate but suggests a customer can simply pay that past due amount. However, when the customer attempts to pay that amount on-line, by using a Debit or Credit Card, an entirely different amount is billed to the customer. Such as, TWICE what was identified in the past due amount.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-3090851-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3090851\"><p>The T-Mobile scam is to PREVENT the customer from paying a past-due amount, and bill the customer that precise amount PLUS another billing which would have occurred in the future month. When the customer notices that scam, by looking on-line and clearly seeing what T-Mobile has done, it makes no difference to place a call to T-Mobile. When the customer complains, T-Mobile simply says they will take care of it -- BUT they don't take care of it.</p><p>In fact, when I personally visited my Bank and complained about the T-Mobile (suspected fraudulent billing practice and their incorrect billing), my own Bank official contacted T-Mobile but was met with an exasperating conversation with a T-Mobile representative who abruptly \"hung up\" on my Banking official. The solution: My Banking official simply disputes the charge in writing, contacts T-Mobile, (receives no response), and then my Bank puts the improperly-charged funds back into my Bank Account. A hassle, of course, but effective. </p><p>Just avoid T-Mobile. T-Mobile is well known to have billing schemes and even worse customer service when their scheme is detected. T-Mobile has already received attention by the Federal Consumer Protection Bureau on numerous occasions. It's unfortunate that the Feds have not yet indicted T-Mobile for fraudulent practices, although I'm certain T-Mobile will be indicted soon.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-3090851\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-3090851\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-3090851-btn\">\n",

What do don't state is, most other carriers phone do not work well with their network. The promotions in signage appear legitimate, however \"read the fine print\" is definitely true when dealing with this company. My AT&amp;T phones rarely have more the 3 bars. I often miss text messages and even e-mail. A problem I did not have when my Galaxy S7 Edge was with AT&amp;T.</p></div>]\n"

I was told it should be okay, I went to their store and I was told the same thing that it shouldn't be a problem since it’s just a day. After getting the new lines, I was told it might take up to 2 hours to get the number ported from previous carrier.

First, I don't exactly live in a remote area. I can literally SEE NYC from my apartment, but even outside, I feel like I'm in the backcountry. On a daily basis, I literally have 4-5 dropped calls while driving (using hands-free device). EVERYDAY. Then, if I am lucky enough to get a stable connection, I can expect half of that time, the other party cannot hear me! I have absolutely NO signal anywhere in my workplace, which is a problem, since we use our phones to stay in contact across the plant, and I am basically the only one with such a pathetically unreliable phone. I have unfortunately been stuck with Third-World Mobile for many months, but I plan to jump ship very soon!

We had a five minute wait for an employee to help us.

The process was efficient and he offered to some phone repair shops around the area that could assist me (even honestly estimating it would ~$200 to fix), but the disrespectful attitude of their associate manager still stings.

After three trips to the T-Mobile store, still had the same issue and was not given a new phone. Dropped T-Mobile for Verizon. T-Mobile refused to unlock the iPhone that we had outright purchased. The customer service line is a joke. When asked to be transferred to a supervisor, the same representative attempted to act like she was someone else twice. When returning the phone to the T-Mobile store I bought it from, the manager stated he couldn't waive the restock fee, but customer service said he could. Customer service also claimed they didn't have supervisors or a corporate office. Never again.</p></div>, <div class=\"rvw-bd\"><span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">Original review: Nov. 11, 2017</span><p></p><p>I feel very disrespected by T-mobile and I will NEVER ever recommend anyone this service. It’s a huge cellphone company, yet they are very inconsiderate and very unprofessional. Long story short, my brother Adam was a T-Mobile customer service rep, and he passed away on July 13. Since August, I have been trying to communicate back and forth with T-Mobile representatives because my brother still has a balance on his phone therefore we can’t sale or get rid of it. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-3023728-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3023728\"><p>I was told since the beginning that we didn’t owe anything and the balance was cleared out completely and that we were able to use the phone or sale it. Since they had told me that, I cleared out everything, deleted everything the phone had and reset to brand new. I tried to use the phone and I couldn’t because the balance was still there, for weeks I went back and forth with T-Mobile trying to understand why they lied to me and why the balance wasn’t cleared out. Again, the 4 different representatives told me that the problem was fixed and the balance was cleared and it wasn’t. Now we're in November and today I called again, still remaining calm and respectful and the first representative told me that the balance is now in the hands of a collection agency and he told me that I had to clear it out with them and he gave me the number to call. </p><p>Although, I was frustrated and fed up I agreed and thanked him and hung up just like I did with the other representatives. I called the suppose Collection Agency and it was fake it was the T-Mobile customer service number. So again I got transferred to another representative who connected me with some man not sure if he was a manager but he told me that T-Mobile doesn’t send balances to collections in situations like this. So in that case I’m responsible for my brother’s balance and there is a lock on the phone until I pay it. I am so angry and hurt because the phone isn’t even worth that much money as the balance and if that was the case I could’ve kept my brother's phone with all of his personal stuff in it. </p><p>Now I have a useless iPhone 6s Plus that I have here that hurts to see when all I wanted to do was get some money for my family to cover some of the funeral cost. My brother also had life insurance with T-Mobile but because of the way he passed they didn’t give it to us. This was very inconvenient for me I wish I was told since the beginning the actual truth. This is the way they pay back their own coworkers. My brother was so proud working there and if he was here knowing this happened to someone else I know he wouldn’t look at this company the same. T-Mobile is really about “Integrity”.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-3023728\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-3023728\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-3023728-btn\">\n",

Now in September I received another bill for $176.00. I called asking for the $140.00 and why I have billed again this time $176.00. I was transferred eight (8) times and spent over two (2) hours on the phone before hanging up.</p><p>The next day I went into the T-Mobile store. The gentleman called customer care. He said a lot of um hmm's which made me very angry. He then hung up the phone and told me they would contact me by letter with an answer and credit if I was owed any money. I then called again a lot transfers and then I was told I would be receiving a check in the mail and the young lady would call me back to confirm my refund in three days. This never happened. I have recently received another bill for a statement credit of $176.00 and a new balance owed for $34.00. I HAVE NOT received a check for the refund of $140.00, $176.00 or $34.00.

The pricing is very competitive, and the coverage keeps getting better. What I am not happy with is some of the hidden fees they don't disclose until something happens. They charge you to do a warranty exchange if you have insurance or not. Their billing systems are easily confused, and sometimes requires calling in to get something resolved.

Buyer BEWARE!! My spouse and I signed up for the 55 and older plan as it was cheaper than ** and had better data plan. Within a few weeks, after a trip to PA, we found out we had areas of spotty or no service. We went back to the store and were told \"maybe it's your phone settings.\" My spouse had purchased a Samsung phone from T-Mobile when we signed up and the phone was paid in full. After less than a month, we decided to cancel and go with another company. Shortly after that, the Temporary Unlock (unknown to us) that was on his phone, was now locked! My spouse was on travel at the time and was told by the 800# Reps that he would have to go to a T-Mobile store. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-3001108-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-3001108\"><p>When he returned from travel, he went back to the local store where the phone was purchased and the store reps told him he had to call customer service. WTH? I might add, since he was past the 14 day limit to return the phone, they had us in a bind and they would not give an inch for the sake of a happy customer. Promise after promise - calling the T-Mobile 800 number only to get someone in the Philippines and to get a US based agent (they weren't any more helpful) required hanging up and redialing in hopes you would get someone in the US. Rep from Philippines lied and said they would note our issues and contact the local store for us and all my spouse had to do was to go back to the store and they would take care of the issue. Guess what? Store said they had no record of this and \"no one called us\". </p><p>I am not exaggerating when I say I spent at least 4 hours over several weeks calling only to have to explain the story over and over. Finally I got a US based agent, who said she would see what she could do to get his phone unlocked. Everyone told me, including her, that to unlock the phone would take 3-5 business days. Say what? She acted like she was not sure, but she would try to get it unlocked and after about 30 minutes on the phone with her, my spouses phone was magically unlocked.

However, when it comes to contacting T-Mobile to get an important account issue resolved like getting an \"authorized user\" removed from your account, T-Mobile never wants to provide their customers with any notes from the call nor do they give us access to the details of what was discussed. For example, I had someone on my authorized user list, meaning they shared the account with me but had their own separate phone. This meant that they could call T-Mobile using my passcode and discuss anything related to the \"joint\" account. But when personal situations changed, I contacted T-Mobile years ago when it happened and talked to a rep for over an hour to get that person removed as an authorized user. They said it was resolved and recently in 2017 I found out that the person was able to purchase a new phone under my account. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-2988982-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-2988982\"><p>Basically, I had no records to prove that I requested the removal of that person from my account and had to go through this process all over again on the phone.

Of course, they didn't include the specific name of the person so I find that odd and I need to be able to reference details like that in the future. So I wrote all this to express how T-Mobile is stingy with the customer's own information. I never see important notes in my T-Mobile account unless it's something super simple like an upgrade on a device or usage details. Let it be something more important where you ask the rep directly if they can send you a statement or document in writing to prove that you requested something and they always say no.

While I was on the phone with customer service representatives of different types (4 or 5 different people) I was told that down payment is based on the credit standing with TMobile. I asked that they reveal to me based on what conditions they estimate the down payment - they refused to answer. I demanded that they run my credit report - they refused to do that too. They did not disclose to me the conditions that I have to meet to qualify for zero down payment nor do they make this information available on their website or in their customer documents. I am appalled at TMobile and I will be taking my business elsewhere.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-2978089\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-2978089\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-2978089-btn\">\n",

This past summer, because of their poor spotty connection I was looking to switch. I bought a one month trial sim card from a T-Mobile store to \"test and see if I get signal.\" Well I do not. Not at all. So the next day I returned it, got a refund and thought I was done. Aug comes, I get a huge bill. I called, went through voicemail from hell since no company actually answers their phone anymore, got switched to several people, a few looked up my account and confirmed I have never actually made any calls and in the end was assured it was taken care of.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-2977252-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-2977252\"><p>Well it's Oct 27th now and I got another bill for 115.00. This time I took down names. Got Mark first. Assured me he would take care of it. I said, \"Yea, like last time? Please give me a supervisor.\" Switched me through to another Mark. Who then switched me through to \"customer loyalty\" and I spoke with Loraine and had to explain it all over. Then she has to switch me over to Ann in customer care, had to explain it all again. She swore it would be taken care of. I said, \"Good but I was told that back in Aug.\"</p><p>This time I will file a complaint with the BBB. Just after I finished doing that the phone rang. Leanne from T-Mobile who wanted to find out whose name is on the bill I got. OH MY GOD! I have explained this mess over and over and they STILL get it wrong? The bill is in MY name but I have not made or received a SINGLE CALL with this company. NO SIGNAL. Had the card for less than 24 hours and returned it. I AM NOT YOUR CUSTOMER. And I love how the bill states if I don't pay they may shut off my phone. It's with AT&amp;T so how do they think they can even do that? They CAN screw with my credit rating though which is why I have to keep trying to get them to fix this mess.</p><p>Somehow when I bought the sim card I got signed up as a customer and their store clerk never \"canceled\" my account that I didn't know I signed up for. I THOUGHT I might do that IF the card worked but since it does not, I returned it, got a refund, thought that was that. So she wants me to sit on hold and talk with customer care.</p><p>At this point I shout STOP. I already talked with Mark, then Mark, then the Loyalty team, then customer care. And did all this back in Aug. too. Now I have to talk with customer care AGAIN? All the while the calls are supposedly recorded. And yet not one department can forward the problem to the next let alone fix it. She assured me she really wants me to speak to customer care so fine, I say ok. Hold music starts playing in some foreign language and so broken up I can barely understand WHAT language. Several minutes later a voice tells me to please keep holding, THEN I PROMPTLY GET CUT OFF. An hour later and no one has called me back.</p><p>So now I'm filing as many complaints as I possibly can. I will keep records of who I did and what was said. And the NEXT bill I get, (and I'm sure I will.) I'll just let go. They will most certainly sell off my \"unpaid bill\" to some collection company, who in turn will foul up my credit rating. I want printed copies of every complaint form I filled out so I can mail those off to all three credit bureaus when the time comes. Unless someone can actually fix this mess. I AM NOT THEIR CUSTOMER. My phone number is with AT&amp;T. I Never was a T-Mobile customer, never made a single call. Had the sim card for less than 24 hours. It doesn't work. WHY do I keep getting bills and WHY can't they be mandated to hire help who can actually do their jobs? PS, this page wants an order number. I'll put the customer account number that shows up on my bill that I never should be getting. It's not an \"order\" number though.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-2977252\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-2977252\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-2977252-btn\">\n",

I used it mostly for travel. Since I didn't use it several months out of the year, I kept it active by paying a small fee each month which included a minor amount of data. Recently I got a new phone (this happened to be with Verizon) which included a hotspot. Since I didn't need the T-Mobile one any longer, I got online and looked for how to cancel my account. I didn't find any clear information. Therefore I called their customer service number, I explained this all to the rep and she told me that the account would be cancelled if I didn't pay it the next month or two. I got the next months bill and ignored it.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-2976793-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-2976793\"><p>When I got the third month's bill saying I owed $60 now, I called again and again explained everything to the rep, she connected me with billing and they insisted that I owed the $60 since I didn't cancel and there was no record of my original call. I tried to explain that my record would show that I never used the hotspot for many months and had been paying all along up to the purchase of the new phone. She said I would be getting a notice. Today I got a demand letter from T-Mobile collections dept. for the $60. This is a ripoff, since it seems the first rep gave me the correct info and/or didn't direct me to where I could find the cancellation info on the website.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-2976793\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-2976793\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-2976793-btn\">\n",

However, the unfortunate thing was that in fact I had purchased my phone through T-Mobile, but they had no record of the purchase. Now today, I am left with my T-Mobile-purchased iPhone box (with their sticker on it!), but because they could not unlock my phone to allow me to use my existing iPhone through Verizon, I had to purchase a brand new phone!

Never suspected that they would be overcharging me for the data I was getting. $109 a month for one V10 and 1gb of 4g data. Super crappy deal. But I thought nothing of it. Kept the V10 in pristine condition until the infamous LG boot-loop had its way with it. Other than the fact that its own software bricked the phone, the phone was perfect. No scratches, no dents, no cracks. Recently moved down to Central Oregon and after the V10 boot-looped I switched to US Cellular where I'm currently using a V20 with unlimited 4g data for only $80 a month along with much better coverage than I ever got with T-Mobile. A much better deal. When I called T-Mobile to cancel my service, they were extremely rude and unprofessional. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-2929347-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-2929347\"><p>I finally got them to cancel my service and they asked me to mail them the V10. I reminded them that it had boot-looped, meaning that the phone was never going to work again. They said that was fine. They just needed it back so I wouldn't get charged. So I mail them the phone. With a sigh of relief I was assured that my horrible experience with T-Mobile was over. But oh boy was I wrong. I get an email about a week later telling me I have to pay $250 because the V10 was broken and wouldn't work. I called customer service to try and figure out what the problem was. I explained that last time I called they asked me to send in the phone, broken or not so that I wouldn't have to pay it off. They say it doesn't matter and because the phone had boot-looped, that falls on me and I have to pay for it. </p><p>So let's recap here. They forced me to pay $250, because a phone they issued me had its own software issue, that is entirely out of the control of the user. My whole experience with T-Mobile was the worst I've ever had with any company, including Comcast! I will never ever use or endorse T-Mobile ever again. If you have to opportunity to avoid this corrupt and mismanaged company, do so as soon as you can. You don't want to be sucked into their **. I'm starting to think they only made me pay because they wanted revenge for me leaving them for US Cellular, a much better run, trustworthy company I feel comfortable with.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-2929347\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-2929347\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-2929347-btn\">\n",

This review is not for the T-Mobile store, but for the phone customer service that I received during an emergency situation. On 10/09/17 3:30 am my husband and I awoke to darkness and without power. I turned on my battery operated radio and discover that Nevada county had fires in several areas. My husband had to leave for his job, and a half hour later I tried to call him and my phone was dead. The message stated that I had to pay for my minutes. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-2914893-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-2914893\"><p>I called 611 for customer care and was told that I did not pay. I gave her the invoice number, code and everything else, and explained to her that I had no power, no phone and that the fires were getting worst. She coldly explain that she couldn't find where I paid and therefore couldn't turn on the phone. I was so upset that I started crying and telling her that Yes I did pay, Yes I have the receipt and after around 20 minutes she decided to turn on my phone but not before telling me that it was up to me to call after I pay for my minutes. NOT TRUE! I finally called my husband and it turned out that the fires were bad. I was tired, upset, nervous. T-Mobile turned off my phone on the same day that I cashed paid 10AM 10/06/17.

I've been using T-Mobile since for the last 4 years, and it was fine until this August when I had to make changes in my plan. It took me more than 5 visits and numerous calls to customer service to transfer from Simple Choice to T-Mobile One. Reps were unable to change my plan on existing account, so they suggested to open a new account, transfer all lines and then close the old account. They couldn't give me a final statement for the closed account right away on Aug. 17, and suggested to wait until it appears on the system so I can pay the remaining balance.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-2911494-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-2911494\"><p>Immediately I ran into minor issues. At first, instead of the family plan for all lines I was put into a separate $70/month plan for each line, so I came back on the next day and it was resolved quickly, however soon after that I discovered that data on some of the lines was not activated. This was also resolved after I've contacted the customer service. But this is really negligible compared to what happened next.</p><p>After the old account was closed, I had no access to view my balance for my old account online and I haven't received any closing statement, so around Aug. 25 I have visited a store and paid the remaining balance. I was assured that there is now zero balance on a closed account, however the only written confirmation they provided was that I have made a payment $28 to my old account.</p><p>One month after, on Sep. 22 I have received a statement for the old account for Aug 13 - Aug 18, where I was charged monthly fees for total $40 for the last 6 days before the account was closed. The due date for the payment was on the next day, Saturday Sep. 23. Ok, since I had no chance to pay this bill online I have visited a store on Sep. 27, explained the situation, stated clearly that I want to make a payment to my closed account and paid remaining $40.</p><p>One week later, on Oct. 02 I have received a notice from a collection agency that my old account has an unpaid balance. It appeared that they have sent my old account to collection on Tuesday Sep. 26, which is TWO business days after I have received a statement in the mail. The same day I called customer service and I was told that my payment somehow was not applied to my old account, but they will fix it right away.</p><p>On Sep. 11 I have noticed that this payment appeared on my new account instead of my old account. I have called customer service again and requested that the payment should be applied to the old account, again I was assured that my request will be satisfied shortly. However, after that, over the phone they were not able to verify that my old account finally had no remaining balance due, because (and I am not joking here) I can confirm my identity with 4 digits of SSN only when contacting them regarding my new account, not my old account.</p><p>This forced me to drive to the store again, just to get a confirmation that there is no any balance due on the closed account. My request to provide a written confirmation that their balance of my old account is zero was denied with another bizarre explanation that I will receive this confirmation with the next statement in the mail. So I am not sure, that the story ends here.</p><p>Summarizing, beware of T-Mobile, you will see the real face of these scammers if you try to close an account. I have all reasons to believe that their procedure to close an account is intentionally made so inconvenient and filled with tricks and catches for the customer. Never believe their claims unless you have received a written confirmation and keep all records when dealing with them.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-2911494\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-2911494\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-2911494-btn\">\n",

I made sure that I confirmed that I am getting the $40 monthly plan per line and was assured that my bill will be $130.00 per month and if I paid via auto pay I will be getting a monthly credit of $10 for doing so and that will bring my bill to a total of $120 + the $20.00 monthly installment on the new phone I purchased bringing it to a total of $140.

This program gives you $10 back for every line that used under 2 gigs of data in a billing cycle. I have a business account so T-Mobile does not allow me to control it manually. Their computer software has to automatically credit the account, which it has not done. Every month I called T-Mobile Customer Service and every month I would get a different excuse as to why the Kick-Back didn't take place. All of the customer service reps that I spoke with could see that I am enrolled in the Kick-Back Program, and they could see that all 3 of my lines used far less than the 2 gigs of data, but none of them had been able to figure out how to get my credits.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-2897769-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-2897769\"><p>Today I was finally connected to someone that could authorize credits but would only be able to get 2 months of credits.

However, no one has been able to answer why the Automatic Credit is not working for my account and what the date of the month is that the computer is supposed to figure this out.

They told me the phone was back ordered, so when I received the phone on 9/28/2017, it was an Aristo phone; the wrong model name. What it appeared is that at the point of shipping they covered up the original serial number designation for the Aristo phone with another label for the REVVL phone. I called them and after almost 2 hours on the phone, they said they would ship me the right phone but wanted me to pay an additional $163.20 for the phone, which I consented to do. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-2891493-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-2891493\"><p>When I received the second phone on a new order number ** on 10/2/2017, they once again shipped me an Aristo phone with the same serial number label covered up with a REVVL label.

Both phones are on the way back to them by UPS. My complaint is not so much that I had to pay for two phones that were never received, but the real point is that there is fraud occurring at T-Mobile, when a person orders and pays for equipment, because the equipment is back ordered, they fraudulently replace the serial numbers on a totally different piece of equipment and ship you the substitute phone. Because this happened twice in a row, I am not the only customer affected in this obvious fraud case.</p></div><div class=\"rvw-bd-glry js-rvw-bd-glry\" data-target-id=\"2891493\"><div class=\"rvw-bd-glry__img\" data-ca-modal-active-pic=\"1\" data-ca-modal-collection='[{\"src\": \"https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/reviews/t-mobile_174708.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": \"https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/cache/reviews/t-mobile_174708_thumbnail.jpg\", \"name\": \"\"}, {\"title\": \"T-Mobile\"}]' data-ca-modal-type=\"gallery\" data-more-images=\"0+\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/cache/reviews/t-mobile_174708_thumbnail.jpg\"/></div></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-2891493\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-2891493\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-2891493-btn\">\n",

If I wanted to make/receive a call I had to travel about a mile/mile and a half. When I inquired about the problem after several time I kept being told it was a problem with the tower caused by the hurricane. Yet in my area other phone companies were operating properly. To be fair, I had had some similar problems PRIOR to the hurricane, at first I thought it was my phone BUT AFTER switching and replacing phones the problems continued so this must have been a preexisting problem that was intensified by the hurricane. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-2874943-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-2874943\"><p>Anyway after about 2 weeks without good service and having to travel to make a call I decided to change carriers.

After arguing with T-Mobile phone reps for much too long, without having anything resolved, and then after discovering that there was an extra 62 pages of our bill, one month, and being sure it was not only one month but every month, it was further researched, and I discovered the following things, along with satisfying my fears and curiosities about the matter.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-2863005-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-2863005\"><p>After becoming educated enough to not allow the people who worked for the T-Mobile company to bully, and victimize, I was able to confidently become more than the chump of the moment for whatever employees may have been taking advantage of the jobs they held, and the availability of personal identifiers of customers. I discovered that there was already, within the T-Mobile Corp, an investigation going on to find out if it was possible that employees were indeed taking advantage of people.</p><p>I discovered that, when I contacted the company for consumer issues, those employees who answered the phones were not in any way required nor even allowed to request information such as social security numbers, and personal information. There was a group within the company who were an organized crime ring and they were using the phone contacts to gather the info needed to do everything from petty thefts, to very organized crime. In the long run, T-Mobile nearly went bankrupt, and at one point there was talk of AT&amp;T buying them out, although I am not sure how all that actually went.</p><p>I also discovered that the unlimited family plans were being taken advantage of by adding extra people to a plan, without the account holder’s knowledge, so a smaller pocket was adding to the grief of the larger organization. The most important thing I discovered though, was that T-Mobile was still the most usable phone company for my needs and had decent enough services, and that the offerings using monthly account plans were the target, and that the prepaid phone services could not be opened to become vulnerable to the same victimization that the service plans were open to.</p><p>And so, we cancelled our monthly account plan, and went to prepaid services. And you know, we have had absolutely zero problems ever since doing that. Problem solved in a way. It’s a way that should not be the only alternative for a consumer to choose, but it does work. And T-Mobile has since, improved their customer service phone assistance dramatically.

I go in and pick up my phone at T-Mobile never being told that I was receiving a 32 gig. So I notice today 12 days later that it is a 32 gig instead of a 64 gig. I call and their only solution was to credit my account $80. So I'm stuck with a phone that I did not purchase and a carrier that lies, deceives and did not give me the opportunity to have freedom of choice to keep my 64 gig Note five. In a Nation where we are granted freedom of choice mine freedom was stripped away from me by this monster of a mobile phone company. Good luck if you go with T-Mobile.

Day one started with problems, my wife's phone would intermittently connect to the network. So we went back to the store to get it fixed. They claimed some crap about the phone and said we have another offer going on, if you give us that phone we will give you a new iPhone &amp; or the same phone Samsung Galaxy S7 FREE!!! And it will work on our network. Great, we go and do that, as we were told at the store we would see a $30 charge for the phone each month and a $30 credit to follow.

In 1 week he used our 200 MB of data somehow. I tried to get his usage increased but was told he could only get a data pass for 50mb @ 15$ a week. Please explain to me how that helps! I was told there was no options to increase above that and regardless that my husband is risking his life to help thousands of people affected by hurricane Irma, the fee couldn't be waived and there was no way to allow him data. I'm extremely shocked at T-Mobile considering the unique situation my husband is in. I find it hard to believe that this company cannot assist the victims and disaster recovery teams or families for that matter of fact! </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-2849781-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-2849781\"><p>Comcast opened their wifi service to THOUSANDS of people whose lives were destroyed yet my mobile carrier can't assist! Then his phone got shut off completely by some \"glitch.\" After spending over 24 hours begging for some kind of compassion &amp; understanding T-MOBILE finally got his phone back on &amp; allowed 50 Gb of data &amp; waived the 15$ fee per week, it lasted 2 days! There is no wifi, no towers, no water, nothing on St Thomas!!! BUT... now he got a SMS that he will be charged .20 per minute for calls even though T-Mobile website says the contrary!!! I spent an hour in the T-Mobile store asking wth is happening now!! I was told there is no guarantee the charges would be reversed if they occur because the US VIRGIN ISLANDS ARE NOT ON THEIR LIST OF DISASTER VICTIMS?!?! Pretty sure that's called price gouging &amp; taking advantage of a deviating situation!! </p><p>I am extremely disappointed in not only the lack of empathy displayed but also the ignorance of this company. The amount of insanity I have gone through on top of the stress of worrying about my husbands life has have been unimaginable!! I have been ASKED to see if my husband could go buy a SIM card! Does T-Mobile NOT understand that this hurricane destroyed St. Thomas! Where would they suggest he but one??? Online? Oh wait that's right he has NO data!! I was asked if I can mail him one... how would T-Mobile have me send it? Carrier pigeon?!?! I was asked to have my husband turn his phone on &amp; off... UM HOW? They sent him an email to confirm his account so they can \"research \". Ummm no data... How do they want him to get that email? Speechless!! I was promised a call back in 48 hours... Yeah nope!! </p><p>I called in asked to speak to a supervisor but was told there was NOT one supervisor on duty... Can't even find a smart ** comment for that one! Seriously dumbfounded!!! Please help me understand!! Wasn't it T-Mobile's CEO said who said... \"We are gearing up to fully support our customers and employers through this monster storm,” CEO John Legere said. “Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone in this path.” Did that include PRICE GOUGING? TAKING ADVANTAGE OF VICTIMS? ENSURING RESCUERS CAN’T REACH THEIR LOVED ONES??? SHAME ON YOU T-MOBILE!! They advertise one thing but can't guarantee it! Someone needs to make sure they are doing the ethical &amp; right thing! </p><p>My husband lucky has me, but what about the families stuck on the island!! Who's going to make sure they are protected from being abused by a corporation? Last time I checked they were &amp; are US citizens!! T-Mobile has unlocked our phones and basically said to leave if we want, however the balance on the phones cannot be waived because another carrier will buy out our balances? They cannot also provide me in writing my husband will NOT be price gouged while over in the US Virgin Islands because other carriers are probably having issues too &amp; that even if he is in the US Virgin Islands THE TOWERS ARE NOT! I was told there was no reason for T-Mobile to compensate or do anything else for us regardless or all the mental stress, anguish, and suffering I have been through the last 72 hours. I was told \"Our other phones work just fine.\" To basically get my husband new service.

When you sign up for \"Jump on Demand\" you aren't necessarily aware that you will pay the quoted amount for 18 months followed either by a balloon payment of the \"residual value\" vs restructuring monthly payments to cover this amount. When you try to pay these amounts off you find that there is a very brief window after paying your most recent bill balance. If you make payments at any other time they go towards the following month's balance and not towards the residual value. Also, T-Mobile makes a big deal about their unlimited data plans and binge video streaming. They are less clear to point out that when you use your smartphone as a mobile hotspot to project to a monitor or TV (as we do when camping) is limited to 10Gb/month followed by throttled down speeds making service useless.</p></div>, <div class=\"rvw-bd\"><span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">Original review: Sept. 20, 2017</span><p></p><p>I have used T-Mobile since 2001 and have always had the best cell service as well as the best customer service even when I was out of state.

I was then offered a promotion to trade my iPhone5s for an iPhone7 with a 300$ rebate (including trade-in value).

But after the first day passed, no more follow-up. My letters to the store and to TMO customer service have remained unanswered so far.

Of course I selected free shipping instead. Yet after I placed my order and received the email confirmation, I was charged for the $6.99 shipping. There was also a glitch in the system so that my apartment number was not shown on the shipping address in the order details. I called up customer service right away (5 minutes after I placed my order) and they told me they couldn't cancel my order because it's a \"pre-order\".

So I had to borrow a phone from my sister for the trip home, I am a cardiac patient with 17 stints and need a dependable phone. Long story short back in Florida within a month the new again phone locks up. Meanwhile my wife sees all the problems I am having and wants nothing to do with the phone. It ended up them suing me for over 1200 dollars, I did not pay, I could not pay, and it ruined my credit for years. I was on disability. I still have the original service from probably 25 years now, my wife likes her old flip phone and that's it. The same service that cost about 70 dollars years ago is now about 30 dollars. If my wife didn't like that phone I would not use them. I have been with Verizon since then with no problems.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-2867748\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-2867748\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-2867748-btn\">\n",

They send me a new phone then I send the AT&amp;T phone back to T-Mobile and they lost it!!! 6 months later still fighting for the reward money when switch companies. I spoke with 12 different people and 3 supervisors (all in Tennessee). NO ONE resolve my problem. It was always a: “Sir we are not have the response from our department in charge, please call back later.” Bottom line they dragged this problem for all 6 months and now, I don't have the reward money, nor phone, and I still have to pay AT&amp;T for the old phone... $40 per line is a good deal but that is also what we get as far as customer service.

They made the adjustment and my bill was $425.00. The next month I get a text message that my services were going to be interrupted if I don't pay the $1,000.00. I went back into the store and they said don't worry we won't shut off your service. 3 hours later all 4 phones were shut off. I went back into the store again this time more irritated.

And after three years with Sprint I decided to switch plans. I brought my own phone to T-Mobile. And told them that I needed an account that would verify with PayPal so I could leave my online store. I was promised by no less than seven people while setting up the account that a no credit check account was the same thing as a regular credit check account. So that's what I did. A week later when it still wouldn't verify with PayPal and I was reading or blog posts I found out that it is not in fact anything like the regular credit check account. So I called T-Mobile and said “What do I need to do to switch my plan to the credit check account.” </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-2798116-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-2798116\"><p>I was told to go into the store and set it up with them which I did. Unfortunately the person that was helping me in the store created a new account after the person on the phone had already created account. And unfortunately put in the wrong Social Security number. So the next morning I wake up to my phone being suspended because of fraud. So I contact T-Mobile and say what's going on and they told me and I said “OK what do I have to do to fix this” so they told me to bring my information down blah blah blah. I did. Three times now. Now my phone is been suspended for about a week and a half. And they put a hold on my phone saying that I/O them 23 more payments so they can lock my phone and keep it bound to T-Mobile while they complete their fraud investigation. </p><p>Keeping in mind I have taken my information down to the store three times and I faxed it myself once. And also keeping in mind that I brought my own phone and now they say that I owe them $340 for my iPhone. Be very careful. Because even if you bring your own phone if they feel like it, they can put a hold on your phone for whatever reason they can come up with and from the second you put a T-Mobile Sim card in your phone, you better bet your sweet ** you're locked to T-Mobile.

In a MN T-Mobile store, asked about switching from current prepaid $45/mo with free One5 8 GB phone, 4 GB fast, to buying the Revvl under a similar or maybe slightly worse agreement. Fine print on phone card said $160. I'm not eligible for $125 cost of phone because of plan I'm now under. Can't start from scratch, &amp; sounded like someone switching from another provider isn't eligible. Who is eligible? Usual fast-talking doubletalk have been hearing for 20 years from all the major &amp; not so major companies. Sounded like would also be forced into a particular higher-priced agreement. Makes me wonder what other surprises would appear after signing their fine print. Switched from Boost to get customer service; competent, friendly help in T-Mobile stores.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-2796283-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-2796283\">\n",

At the Mall of America, you can't escape the deafening roar. The store was so much louder, had to ask my question in the noisy walkway. Alternative is to call customer service &amp; talk to nice people in the Philippines or whatever. With limited English skills. Seemed to be same as used by Boost: still trying to figure out why one guy uses some device that makes him sound like a robot.

I spoke to someone on the phone and ordered this GREAT plan (10G Data, Unlimited Talk and Text and ALL for just $50, T-Mobile will cancel my contract with Sprint and pay off my iPhone so I can use it). The rep said the only catch is that I will need to purchase any phone with them to use for the first couple weeks while they are paying off my old device and unlocking it so I can use it.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-2790778-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-2790778\"><p>So... I do it and pay $225 which includes this device and the first month of plan payment. Next I was to wait for my new phone to come in... Well... The new device comes in and I call the number listed on the form. PHONE CALL # 1 The person on the phone is hard to understand and it sounds like he is in the room surrounded by hundreds of people. Finally I am activated! So I check my new SUPER DUPER plan and it shows NOTHING! No data, 30 messages available and unlimited talk... Hmm that's not what I signed up for.</p><p>PHONE CALL # 2, \"No problem you called the right person and I will switch you over to the plan you are mentioning.\" DONE. Now I have 10G of data and the whole nine. I still don't know how they will pay off my iPhone with Sprint since I didn't provide them with any information. CALL # 3 This phone call went on for 2.5 hours and about 4 different departments. I am told that, \"The plan you chose doesn't qualify for this promotion,\" so basically Sprint will send me the last bill and I have to pay for it out of pocket! So I ask, \"What can we do to fix this\"... \"We can put you on a plan that is $70 per month and we will charge you ALL over again the activation fees, we will not reimburse you for the other plan at all.\"</p><p>How could you charge me for your mistakes? After that they simply couldn't figure out how to make this right, which is shocking to me. You can't put me on this new plan that I am willing to pay EXTRA $20 a month for and basically not charge me activation fee that I already paid 7 days ago for a plan that I will NEVER use? After speaking to many departments I was close to crying and all they offered is to give me money back for the device (I think its $120-$160 out $225 I paid).</p><p>So at this point T-Mobile cancelled my Sprint service, transferred my old number, and NOW they are canceling with me as well, so I have no provider and I am to pay for something I have never used + pay Sprint for canceling and paying off the device. We are talking about $800 dollars. I was in shock and I refused that option because that means I'm without a phone! So I hung up and called Sprint asking them to put me back on their plan, and now I am hoping that after explaining this situation to my credit card company they will resolve this issue and help me get the money back from T-MOBILE. I am so amazed that a phone company can't resolve their own mistakes and if that's not bad enough put you in a situation where you need to pay lots of money to resolve it, not to mention the time. STAY AWAY!</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-2790778\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-2790778\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-2790778-btn\">\n",

The promotion at that time was, \"Get 3 lines for $140.00 and line #4 is free\". We signed and paid the initial fees. About a week later T-Mobile had the same deal/promotion with a lower monthly fee of $120.00. I called T-Mobile to ask if that promotion can be apply to my \"very recently\" created account. According the T-Mobile CS Rep. the promotion was for new clients only, therefore I did not qualified because my account was already created in their system. The T-Mobile Rep. explained to me, they had another promotion \"only for existing clients\" for such I qualified. The promotion, \"Get two additional lines for free\". I could not believe it, I had to ask the Rep. to review my account and the promotion \"multiple times\". After a while, I was starting to believe him, but still it was too good to be true.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-2774155-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-2774155\"><p>So, I decided to call the T-Mobile store where I signed up from. I explained the promotion to the Store Rep. and asked him if that was true, his replied, \"yes it is true.\" I asked him if I had to pay anything and he said, \"you do not have to pay, the two extra accounts will be free.\" Well I still was not 100% sure about all this, but when the manager came to talk to me, he review my account and the offer (from the store computer), and he told me that it was true and that I qualified. I proceeded to go to the store and to get my two additional \"free\" lines. I went to the store with some family members that like me, they thought it was too good to be true, so we asked the rep. that was taking care of us at the store and both, him and his Co-worker received our account and the promotion and advised us it was okay to proceed, the promotion was real and we qualified for it.</p><p>Well since then things got out of control with my bills. Every month we receive a \"surprise\", most bills are around $200.00 and a few are as high as $312.00. Every month I have to call T-Mobile and explains how I was \"tricked\" into getting two extra lines \"for free\". At the beginning they say, we do not have a plan that offer more than two lines for free, but after they listen to me and read the notes on my account, they all agreed with me, they apply some kind of discount to my account and then they assure that I will not have to call them back because they are fixing my account (yes, every month I have to call them \"multiple times\", and spend a lot of time on the phone with them). On two of my calls I was told, my situation was being escalate it to \"Customer Retention\" or something similar.</p><p>One time I received a call from a person that stated, she work for that department. She said that my account was reviewed. Some discounts were applied and since she did not have enough authority to do it, she was escalating the issue to her manager (that was over 5 months ago). Today I saw another $200 plus bill and I decided to Call T-Mobile. Long story short, the rep. told me that she was sorry that an employee gave me the incorrect information, but it is the company T-Mobile policy not to have more than two \"free\" lines per account. I explained to her that I signed contracts with them agreeing to certain terms and that is their Legal responsibility to honor their word and the contract, but she basically said that I have to understand that every body makes mistake and that T-Mobile will not change their policy just because some of their representative are making false representations.</p><p>Additionally, we were provided with \"free\" phones, but when we told them that we are switching to another carrier they said, we do not have a long term contract with them, but if we switch, they will not accept any of the 6 phones and we will have to pay $200 \"per phone\" back to them. We are very frustrated with this company; Customer Service/sales Reps. and phone signal are horrible.

Towards the end of last year (2016) T-Mobile said my wife and I needed to upgrade our phones to keep up with changes and it would cost 60.00 a phone. OK. They billed 5.00 more on my bill making it 67. And change. In March they said they were going to give us free phones. Well I asked if they would take the 5.00 charge off my bill. They said no. Well I had just bought these phones. They were like new, and now I could not use them any longer. I would give them back. No. Still had the boxes they had come in. So my wife and I started to look for a new provider. We found PCS mobile.

I got a full month bill - automatic bank withdrawal - on 8/15. I called and the rep explained to me that in \"terms and conditions\", once a billing cycle is started, I will get billed for the full month! Those are unethical business practices, that the Federal Commission should not allow. As I paid my telephone bill twice that month (to Verizon and T-Mobile!). And paid T-Mobile for services I did not use. That is T-Mobile's way to say thanks after all those years as a customer. And T-Mobile's way to ensure that if I change my mind I will return! Right??? After such poor treatment, my phone provider will be anyone else THAN T-Mobile! John Legere can look cool on any TV money channel - should apply some honesty to the delivery of services and train his employees with that in mind!</p></div>, <div class=\"rvw-bd\"><span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">Original review: Aug. 21, 2017</span><p></p><p>I was one day late on a phone bill. My fault. I go into TM to pay the bill at the end of February. Phone is turned back on. I also purchased a chip in case I needed another line. The guy said the line was free which it was but I have plenty of devices. Did not need one. March I go back in because my acct. for bills TM tries to draft almost 350 dollars. Call TM and they said they would take care of it. April still not done. May still not done. Call in. Pay my bill in full as I do every month and to make sure this comes off. Never once mentioned in all those moths about a unpaid bill. The investigation that was done is the real crime. The person that was in charge is a crook.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-2752129-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-2752129\"><p>All of a sudden it wasn't the device. It became a mysterious unpaid bill that 10 people before him never saw. And as of today it was noted on the account in February. Now today this was noted in Feb. The card on file was incorrect and I did not pay for March as well. Has anyone walked in a TM store with phone disconnected had them turn it on and then skip another payment in March. Now the girl at the store was going to take care of it because she remembered that day cause she helped. Got to go to my bank and pull all records. Employees are too sharp but they do have some good ones as well.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-2752129\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-2752129\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-2752129-btn\">\n",

After further checking on coverage it was determined the phone service from T-Mobile would not meet my needs in many of the smaller cities I travel to. I called T-Mobile and they said to refuse the phone. I did that. They received the phone on 8/11. The W/B number confirmed the receipt. Now they say phone was not returned. What they did with the unopened package after they received it is out of my control. Many people have complained of the phones they returned not being received in Connell, TX.</p></div>, <div class=\"rvw-bd\"><span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">Original review: Aug. 17, 2017</span><p></p><p>My mom switched from T-Mobile in March, due to not having good signal EVER!!! Well, during the switch, she noticed that her bill was not accurate to the numbers for the payment plans on phones. Now mind you, she has been with T-Mobile for 16 years, never late and always paid her bill. But anyway, she contacted them about the bill, because it needed to be correct for her to receive her payoff from the other company to switch. She was informed that the bill would be corrected and she should receive it soon.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-2741941-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-2741941\"><p>Needless to say, that was a lie! She only received a final bill with NO CORRECTIONS! Once you leave, you cannot go online and look at your bill anymore. So, she did receive a refund from the other company for a portion of the phone plan with T-Mobile, but not all of it, due to the error on the bill. And they billed her a FULL month of service that she did not even use, because she had switched already.</p><p>So now, they say she owes them $1164.93 for a full month service, partial paid phone plans that the other company lied and said they would pay, and the remaining balance of a phone that she cannot get paid for, because T-Mobile will not correct the bill. She also made payments in June and July, but when she went to make another payment, she was told it was sent to collections. But she was told before that as long as she makes payments it would not go to collections. She is very upset, because now, they are messing with her credit, which is EXCELLENT! I wish people would just be honest when you call these places and not take advantage of the elderly!</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-2741941\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-2741941\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-2741941-btn\">\n",

I'm not rich, in fact I'm struggling like most Americans. So when T-Mobile literally steals $55 from me it is a big deal, not so much the money but the principle. I bring in a phone and open up an account with T-Mobile, $55 for one month. As I'm waiting I'm literally resetting the phone. I get my sim card and finish resetting in front of the store, and then there's a problem. FRP activation lock. I entered the correct email, correct password, it won't work. I go back inside, T-Mobile rep messes with it, tells me to contact cust service. I do.

Have been calling and going to stores almost monthly to try and resolve this issue and half the time, the T-Mobile staff do not believe me when I tell them it's a coverage issue pinning the blame on my non-T-Mobile phone WHEN my grandmother's, which is T-Mobile, also does not work here at home. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-2730594-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-2730594\"><p>Instead they either give me empty promises of 'fixing' cell towers in the area or straight up turn it into a sales pitch when they discover my phone isn't T-Mobile.

On July 14, 2017, I called their agent, and asked for the payoff amount to pay off the EIP plan. I did this because I wanted to verify the exact amount needed to pay off the EIP. It seems that the numbers reflected on the bill and website are a month ahead - the total amount due is deducted from the amount due on the website when it is billed - not when a payment is received. So their own employee, who did not know this, quoted me a payoff number that was one payment short - even after assuring me that I was paying off the account in its entirety! Imagine my surprise when I got the bill this month, and it shows a EIP payment due, while the website showed a ZERO BALANCE on the EIP!</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-2728992-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-2728992\"><p>So, I called them, and all I got was attitude. They admitted that I had called on July 14th, that I had been quoted the payoff by their staff, that I had paid the amount I was quoted, and that their personnel screwed up by quoting the wrong amount - no fault of my own at all. Nice of them to admit their mistake. But they flatly refused to do anything about it at all. Not even a courtesy $1.00 coupon for future purchases. T-Mobile's customer service SUCKS! They don't actually transfer you to \"the customer loyalty department\". They just transfer you around the room so you tell your story multiple times then give up. They admit THEIR mistake (I paid the amount they told me was correct payoff amount in good faith), but they won't do ANYTHING about it. After almost fifteen years with T-Mobile, I am done with them! I'm headed to Family Mobile at Wal-Mart or to Sprint or to anyone else. </p><p>As an aside; and additional frustration; this phone they sold me has many issues, and all they can do is hard-boot and reinstall their OS to try to fix it. This does not work. One issue is the phone, when using speaker phone mode, randomly exits speaker mode for no apparent reason. Another thing that deeply concerns me is I mentioned to a friend in a verbal conversation the cost of caskets (was talking to him about HIS father's funeral). I did not text, I did not e-mail, and I did not mention it in any other context beyond one telephone conversation. Within a hour or two my e-mail and Facebook began filling up with ads for funerals and funeral homes. I don't appreciate Big Brother listening to my conversations with voice recognition software and then selling it to ad agencies to market to me stuff I don't need! I may be going back to a old fashioned landline and throwing the cell phone away entirely.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-2728992\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-2728992\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-2728992-btn\">\n",

No one never said such things when I go in the store to pay. They say $160. Now eight months later customer service says it's $240 monthly. Someone told me wrong. Sad company.

For 2 days in a row now, I've tried trading in my brand new J7 Prime because it's the worst phone I've ever had the displeasure of owning, not to mention the fools don't even carry a fitted case for it, which therefore forces you to buy insurance! ALL of T-mobile so-called \"Help\" topics and troubleshooting instructions are WRONG! Not one tip or step by step help worked at all, so you can't even figure out how to do most of the things that are simple on all of the S's, therefore after only a couple weeks of having it, I go and try to upgrade and it's been the most horrifying struggle and nightmare I've ever encountered with ANY COMPANY, from being hung up on again and again AFTER being transferred AGAIN AND AGAIN, just to make me do it all myself online, that I had issues with doing PRIOR to calling the mindless sheep like reps! </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-2722476-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-2722476\"><p>Then to top it all off, after hours and finally getting a rep to order another Galaxy S7, I get an email less than a day later telling me they cancelled my order due to me not signing the doc-u-sign within 48 hours!

I literally had to go through the same trying, stressful, painful &amp; draining nightmare twice – all over again just to REORDER THE SAME CELL THEY CANCELLED and had to DO IT MYSELF AGAIN ONLINE because THEY SOLD THE ONE THEY CANCELLED and probably that is why they just suddenly, without authorization, cancelled my order in the first place, so the IGNORANT SHEEP could sell it to someone else!

I was excited to transfer from my overinflated Verizon service and their crazy fees to the Un-Carrier T-Mobile. I brought my own phone and I am on my way with unlimited service. I love the service so much I bought my first wearable the Samsung S3 Frontier and paid the watch in full. Also bought a LG Tablet with the cost of the Tablet being returned to me via prepaid card when approved. Awesome deal if everything worked as stated.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-2721198-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-2721198\"><p>Now the fun begins. I had an issue with my watch and had to exchange it. Even though it was within the manufacturers warranty of one year, I was charged $20.00 and now have a refurbished watch instead of the new unit I had paid full price for just 60 days ago. This does not sit well with me but it gets worse. Even though I used the return label T-Mobile sent me to return my watch it somehow went to the wrong warehouse and was never logged in. Can you guess the rest of the story? Yep, I am being charged for the watch their poor quality control failed to log-in. Suddenly, I have a $403.00 dollar bill that their team cannot fix. Finally, after I gave them proof of shipping and customer service filing several request to search for the device it was found. Now they issue me a bill credit of the $403.00 which does not help pay my other bills that were delayed because T-Mobile charged my debit card on file. Bill credit is not a refund. Errr.</p><p>As all this is going on with the watch I receive a notice that the tablet I purchased on payments expecting a prepaid card back to pay for the tablet in full did not meet the qualifications to receive the prepaid card. Errr. Now my expected bill is raised to pay the tablet payment until this is worked out. Two months of back and forth and T-Mobile finally determines the Tablet does qualify for the prepaid card.</p><p>Throughout my travel I now find out my old Verizon phone will not receive data coverage in Alaska or Canada. Therefore, I purchase a New Kyocera DuraForce Pro. I paid for the unit in full. I get the phone and find out it will not work with Samsung pay as a warning window pops up and says to un-root my phone for security reasons to use Samsung pay with the watch and phone. Why is my new phone rooted? </p><p>After several calls to T-Mobile they finally send me a pre-paid label to exchange my phone for a new un-rooted phone. Can you guess the rest of this story? Yep, the phone goes to the wrong warehouse and never logged in. Now I am being charged $475.00 from my debit card on file for autopay. This is money I don't have in my account and T-Mobile cannot immediately take care of the issue even though I have proof the phone was returned, worse, account resolution can tell it was returned but still has to file a search for device form which can take weeks or, as in the last case of the watch several months. Errr.</p><p>Here is my honest thoughts of T-Mobile service and it's very late so please excuse any typos or misspelled words. The Un-Carrier has a quality service that is difficult to distinguish from any other wireless phone service. Their all-in pricing without all the crazy fees is excellent. However, the weakest link is their support and their company divide or policy. You cannot obtain local store support for a device purchased from T-Mobile online. This policy is beyond understanding and I would encourage T-Mobile to rethink this policy, as, their competitors do not seem to adopt this complicated support policy. </p><p>I find their front line phone support staff amazing with an eager to please and desire to exceed expectations attitude. Where the ball is dropped is after the front line staff handles an issue it still needs to be reviewed, approved by a person above them and unfamiliar with the situation. This communication breakdown is evident and the weakest link. If T-mobile can work out the support issues I believe they will lead the industry of wireless communications. Godspeed.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-2721198\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-2721198\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-2721198-btn\">\n",

When I contacted T-Mobile customer service they are saying that the order is already placed and call the Shipping services UPS to change your shipping address, when I called UPS they said that we didn't received the order yet call T-Mobile to change the shipping address. I again called T-Mobile. After 50 minutes in call they simply said that create a account in UPS My Choice and change delivery address, after creating account in UPS My Choice also I was unable to change my shipping address. The order is going to be shipped by 8/9/2017 by 3 pm itself, what I have to do if that shipment is shipped to the wrong address.</p><p>On single day for almost 2 hours I am in call with both T-mobile and UPS to rectify my problem from my side itself but it didn't worked. I think that to rectify a problem that T-mobile has created to me I should take a day off from my work, lose my one day pay and talk with them from morning to evening, but still these will not respond to the issue the customer is facing. I paid my bill, but still I am not getting a basic service like shipping the product also from T-mobile even for the new customer also. How can I expect these people will do correct billing in future, now I have to stick to this horrible T-mobile connection for 24 months from now on wards.</p><p>Updated on 8/26/2017: On 08/15 I got an email stating that they received one phone and processed my return on 08/16. I got only $132.01 out of $306.77 total payment. When I called T-mobile and inquired about remaining amount they told that the remaining amount can be send as a gift card to my address (which is wrong address where they have shipped the mobiles) I requested them to return to the debit card which I used to pay the bill, they told that by 08/24 it will be returned but I didn't get anything. I got an email on 08/24 saying that the other phone is also received and the sim cards are also received the return amount of $174.76 is credited, but still I didn't get any amount in my account. When I called them they told that the issue is escalated and refreshed and it may take 3 more business days.</p><p>On 08/26 early hours I got a notification that $160.26 is debited from my account by T-mobile. I worried why and I called them again. I called them again what is happening. They simply told that it is the bill they charged for the service they provided me. I don't know what service they provided me. I didn't had any phone or any number. I didn't even received anything from T-mobile, but still they charged. I called them on same day 08/26 when I asked about the issue they simply told that the amount will be received in 3-4 business days that is by 08/31. To rectify one issue I am talking to the T-mobile for almost 1 month fully, they are still deducting the amount from my account and saying that it will be refunded and for that also I only have to call them every 4 days once and ask them what is happening.</p><p>I need some justice from T-mobile by torturing me like this, what I have to do to T-mobile now. I would like to attach the image of the T-mobile transactions also, but I am unable to attach them as the images also include my personal transactions. I also cannot provide the receipt of the amount $174.76 which is refunded to my account on 08/24, that email consists of my personal information.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-2709045\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-2709045\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-2709045-btn\">\n",

Every month in my statement there was supposed to be a credit, they did it for a few months then they stopped. They said I didn't qualify when I called them I'm not sure why. On my statement I'm still paying a full phone. I call many times and everyone has a different story, they have no idea how to work. Plus, now they want to change my plan and I refuse to do so.</p></div>, <div class=\"rvw-bd\"><span class=\"ca-txt-cpt\">Original review: Aug. 5, 2017</span><p></p><p>I am going to Canada next week for a two week stint and am currently with US Cellular. Yesterday was my last day off before I leave. While in Canada I will not have access to wifi or landline phones. I wanted to be able to communicate with my family without it costing $0.60/MB. I saw the ad for T-Mobile saying they'd pay off your current phone if you switched service, and that they had free voice/text/data roaming in Canada. I also saw that they had the new Galaxy S8 and there was a deal where if you bought two they'd give you a $750 gift card. I called customer service that morning to inquire whether I could use both promotions (the phone payoff and the $750 gift card) and they assured me that I could. I also confirmed and reconfirmed the plan would be what I needed. I asked the other general questions about porting the numbers, how long it takes to get the gift card, etc. My questions were answered satisfactorily at that time. </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-2702898-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-2702898\"><p>Feeling optimistic, I called the closest T-Mobile Store which was an hour away. I verified that they had two S8's in stock and let them know that I would be down once my wife got out of work. They told me everything would be good to go, and that once I paid we would submit for the gift card before we left the store. Fast forward to just before 6pm. I had picked up my wife and we were at the T-Mobile store which closes at 8pm, along with our 4 month old son. The person I had spoken on the phone with (who was the asst. manager) had noticed me and acknowledged why we were there - so far so good. There was a couple in line ahead of us, so we waited, again, no problem. Finally it was our turn. The process went very slowly which I attribute to the employee being new. The employee then mis-explained a thing about wifi calling which my wife then interpreted as something more of a full time \"hot-spot\" that we couldn't shut off. </p><p>It was a slight annoyance, which I assured to my wife was not the case. Then the employee tried to sell me on the next higher plan, kudos to him, but he made it sound like the Canada and Mexico roaming was not available on the first level of the plan (which it absolutely is). Okay, fine, new at the job I get it. At this point I'm a little annoyed, but hanging in there. Meanwhile another couple was dealing with the other new employee - having about as much luck as we were. We had been there for nearly 40 minutes at this point. Then the first issue, they couldn't process the credit report to get the financing for the phone... They had entered my SSN incorrectly. Okay, typos happen, no biggie. That took about 15 minutes to fix. At this point the assistant manager left and it was just us, the two new-ish employees and the other couple that were trying to buy a phone. </p><p>Finally, with the credit bit fixed and having to state my SSN out loud in the store no less than 13 times, and writing it down for them, it was time to bring out the phones. The first phone wouldn't activate, it took 10 minutes before they realized the sim card doesn't come installed. SIM card is now installed. My number gets ported over... But there's an issue, my wife's number had been added to my SIM as a virtual line - another call out to customer service, another wait, and then start the process over. Suddenly, a lady bursts in the store asking for a cell phone charger and jumps ahead of us mid-transaction. Rather than have the lady wait her turn, all of our stuff was put on hold, while she tried out several different chargers and couldn't get them to work. Now it's almost closing time, and my number is ported over, and it's time to do my wife's number - sorry, can't do it. </p><p>My wife was devastated, we've each had our numbers for over a decade and this was the first time EVER that we had any issue porting the number over. She reluctantly agreed to get a new number. Finally, the phones were all set - kind of. Time to redeem the code for the gift card - account not found. Tried it again using a different PIN (not the one I set up), account not found. Again with the SSN - account not found... Another call to customer service, \"sorry, but we can't process that. You'll have to wait 24 hours and try again.\" No thank you. I don't have any more time off. At this point we've been in the store for two hours. My baby is hungry and starting to get fussy. I tell them that the gift card is a deal breaker and I want to cancel the entire transaction. They said they couldn't do it. I told them that my wife and I were willing to wait while they found a way. Needless to say, they could do it, but they didn't want to.</p><p>I asked them to refund my credit card the nearly $200, and they gave me a refund receipt that was more than $80 less than what I had been charged. I brought the issue up and they told me not to worry about it. I'm a pretty reasonable guy, but at this point I had developed a trust issue. I asked that they write their name and employee number down on the receipt and annotate that I was supposed to receive a refund in the total amount. Now, for whatever reason, maybe just a coincidence, the employee decided to write his name and employee number down, then use a different color pen to write the difference due back. Could be a coincidence, but based on how this transaction has gone thus far I'm not taking any chances. They decide to call the manager. Now it's well past closing time, my 4 month old is balling his eyes out because he's hungry. This has gone on too long. </p><p>I talk to the manager who made it a point to say that I was wasting my time and could be like him and be at home with my family rather than standing my ground. He said he was doing me a favor by not charging the restocking fee and he guaranteed me that I would get the full amount refunded. (I would later overhear him tell the employee to just do a reset and treat the phones as new, sorry future customer that gets a phone with my prints all over the screen.) I explained to him that a verbal guarantee meant absolutely nothing without written proof, especially based on the events so far. His attitude on the phone was rude, insulting and inconvenienced. At this point I asked him how it worked that as a manager, he would leave the store to be run by two new employees. He said he had done all he could do and that I should just leave and there was no reason for him to come in. </p><p>I asked for a statement or anything from the finance company that showed that I was not responsible for paying the $1500 for the two S8's, \"Sorry we can't do that.\" - Yeah right, try again. This resulted with more phone calls to customer service while we waited, simply trying to get our account canceled. I asked for the district manager's contact information at this point - this is when I was made aware that the employees never hung up with the manager and that I had secretly been on speaker phone the whole time. It's funny how the tune changes from \"We can't do that\" to \"Here you go sir\" the second you mention a district manager. The manager actually decided that he would drive in and assist his team at this point. He was there within 5 minutes. After we had been waiting for 3 hours, he was there in 5 minutes. It took him about 2-3 minutes to get the documentation that I had requested and we were on our way. </p><p>Fast forward to today. I'm at work, can't leave and my phone still isn't working because T-Mobile hasn't released my number for the port back to US Cellular yet... I can tell you that I prepared as much as possible to know exactly what I wanted before even heading to the store. I called ahead and made sure everything was all set and did my best to be the easiest customer they could ever want. I hate being \"that guy,\" I can count on one hand the number of times I've been this upset with any customer service of any type in the past 15 years and two of those experiences are with T-Mobile (the other being about 10-15 years ago). I now remember why I left, and cannot for the life of me understand how they could be rated number 1 in any type of customer service. If they competed against swine flu, I would vote for swine flu over them.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-2702898\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-2702898\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-2702898-btn\">\n",

Mindless sheep who could care less about reality, or justice, in the T-Mobile world all that matters is company policy and how best to take advantage of their own customers. I've been a customer for almost 2 years, recently I got myself a new phone, actually my 3rd phone. So I head over to the T-Mobile store to pickup a sim card and this thing going... I should've known better, for a simple trip to the cell phone store always turns into a walk thru of a new car sales lot... Blah blah blah blah these reps are really trying to sell me a new phone, when I have one in my hand trying to turn it on... Finally I get the answer I'm looking for....\"Yes we have a sim card for sale, and the price is $50.\" WTF I think, $50 for a sim card, yup trying to get over on me... I should've known better... I head home, get online and within 2 minutes I'm in the check out cart with my new sim, for only $10... That's $40 savings, wow T-Mobile is a bunch of **!! </p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-2690961-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-2690961\"><p>Whatever I press purchase, and my auto notification goes off. Money has been debited from my card... But...T-Mobile has come up with some dumb error... Call the 800 number... So I do just that, and after literally being passed 5 different times, I learn that some stupid error happen that nobody can explain, and that I can't make this purchase online, I have to go back to the store... \"Wait,\" I say, \"so you're saying I'm gonna have to spend $40 extra dollars for no reason just cause you guys have some stupid glitch you can't explain... You gotta be kidding me...\" Well long story short, I'm passed around literally 6 more times till finally someone just puts me out of my misery and hangs up on me... As it stands now. I went on to Amazon and bought my $10 sim, however unbelievably T-Mobile mislabeled my package and now it's lost... They lost a one day ship Amazon prime ship... Unreal... So now they still haven't cancelled my online order, or refunded my money... </p><p>They still won't let me buy anything online, and maintain that I must buy from the store... Soooooo I cancelled my account and walked... Took my 3 cell phones, 3 tablets, 4 hotspots to a competitor... And now in my off time I write rants about how crappy T-Mobile is, and how I've taken up T-Mobile bashing to anyone that will listen as a hobby... If I could turn it into a full paid profession I would... There is no company with worse customer service, and worst general logic than this band of idiots... If it wouldn't put many people out of work, I'd be the first one on the charge to have them fined and disbanded for crimes against intelligence...** T-Mobile... This is post 287 and counting... Maybe I'll slow down around a thousand...</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-2690961\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-2690961\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-2690961-btn\">\n",

Immediately I called T-Mobile and paid the amount with my credit card on the phone and after over 4 months it's still on my credit report and T-Mobile and their collection agency refuse to give me a detail final bill so Sprint can refund my $430 or to have it removed from my account. Until today I'm not sure why and what I paid for. All they are now telling me is that there is a 00 balance on my account and they no other record.

Where I live and work was and still is not a 4g lte area it's 2g - 3g. I was lied to from the beginning. They said for more than a year that a new tower is in and will be active and then said it is active. The tower is 100 yards away no one has worked on it. My phones don't connect to it. I received 1 free month of service out of the 2 plus years. My neighbor has the same service and has received 13 months of free service now he has recorded a rep telling him that T-Mobile has been lying to him that the tower is not scheduled to go online till the end of July 2017 to receive 4g.</p><div aria-labelledby=\"review-entry-2666945-btn\" class=\"js-collapsed\" id=\"review-entry-2666945\"><p>I feel that T-Mobile owes me a refund of 2 years of half my payments at least. They have lied and ripped me off for a lot of my hard earned cash and don't care. Customers need to know how they operate first hand. T-Mobile is the worst provider and they will rip you off. All they care about is money. I myself am going to take them to court and I will win.</p></div><a aria-controls=\"review-entry-2666945\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"ca-a exp-btn ca-a--bld-no-undln\" data-expand-collapse='{\"expandText\":\"Read full review\", \"collapseText\": \"View less\", \"target\": [\"#review-entry-2666945\"]}' data-expand-collapse-action=\"expand\" data-uapi-content-toggle=\"review_text\" id=\"review-entry-2666945-btn\">\n",
